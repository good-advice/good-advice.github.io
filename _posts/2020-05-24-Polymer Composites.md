## **Cold-sintered ceramic polymer composite (CSP)**
[1] releases a quite broad methodology (composition and process) to produce cold sintered ceramic polymer composites. The cold process (less than 200 C) and a wide variety of monomers permit the incorporation of diverse inorganic compounds in a polymeric matrix. The actual sintering process involves the application of high temperatures, typically above 1000 C, to densify and to enhance properties of materials (strength, electrical/thermal conductivity, translucency). Although some advances where made reducing the production temperature (between 450 to 750 C), the author claims incredibly low temperatures. The polymer composite is made by:
- An inorganic compound (mainly metal oxides) in the form of particle of 30 micron disperse in a solvent
- A monomer or oligomer or reactive polymer chosen in a broad variety of materials involving ring-opening, radical, thermal polymerization
- Additives for polymerization (initiator or catalysts) and fillers
In a stainless-steel die, exposing the mixture to a temperature less than 200 C where polymerization starts and the solvent evaporates under a pressure control (less than 5000 MPa). [2] enlarges the production process assuming that the inorganic compound is mixed with a preformed polymer solubilized in a solvent. In this case, the required sintering temperature must be higher than the melting point of the polymer and the boiling point of the solvent.
[3] covers the use of volcanic rock as polymeric additives. Volcanic rock of igneous or eruptive composition resulting from the cooling of the magma are porous and have high capability of adsorbing liquid and organic compound and can be used as deodorizing agent. Chemically, the structure of volcanic rock is composed on average by 90 wt % amorphous silico-aluminate and other metallic oxides.

## **Solid polymer electrolyte for batteries**
Solid polymer electrolytes provide promising opportunity to tackle the growing market of rechargeable (secondary) batteries. They do not suffer of leakage but also, they do not promote lithium dendrites, i.e. microscopic damaging metal fibers. [4] proposes a compound of silica, fluorinated polymer and lithium salt, usable as solid electrolyte with improved electrical conductivity. In the form of a film between the two battery electrodes, the compound releases lithium ions when discharging and absorbs lithium ions when the battery is being charged. Keys finding of the patent are:  the polymer is a polyvinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP, 98-2 mol %); the nanoparticles of silicon dioxide are dispersed in water having a pH higher than its isoelectric point; the mixture of the two ingredients is finely dispersed by a high shear mixer (e.g. microchannel homogenizer) to form a gel before drying; the lithium salt is an ionic liquid with pyrrolidium rings; the compound film is made by hot pressing.
A fuel cell is a cell for converting a reaction energy of a gas as raw material directly into an electric energy and hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells are studied for their little adverse effect on the global environmental since they produce water. They use a proton conductive ion exchange membrane as a polymer electrolyte and particularly a membrane of perfluorocarbon polymer having sulfonic acid groups., In polymer electrolyte fuel cells, gas diffusible electrode layers are disposed on the both side of the ion exchange membrane and a gas containing hydrogen as a fuel and a gas containing oxygen (e.g. air) as oxidizing agent are supplied to an anode and to a cathode respectively to generate electric energy. The reduction reaction of oxygen on the cathode proceeds via hydrogen peroxide generation especially when the humidity of the air is low. Only perfluoro polymers with sufonic groups have a greater stability to radicals than hydrocarbon polymers. [5] discovers an improved stability when cerium or manganese ions are present in the membrane, probably proving a rapid decomposition of the adsorbed peroxide. The process proposes a membrane produced from a liquid solution of a perfluorpolymer with a sulfonic terminal and carbonate of cesium (or manganese) in water (or alcohol).

## **Plastic Metallization**
[6] deals with metallizing plastic components. Metallized plastic components have the same high-quality look and feel as chromium plated metal part but are lighter, corrosion-proof and less costly to produce. For these reasons, they are used in auto manufacturing for radiator grilles or mirror caps, as well as for electronic appliances and bathroom fittings. Plastic is gradually replacing metal as the basic material for such applications for good reason and their production method, injection molding, is a much cheap and environmentally compatible form of manufacturing. However, the patent highlights two major drawbacks of the industrial production:
- At the first step, the polymer (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polycarbonate or their blends) surface is etched using chromo-sulfuric acid to form micro-caverns in which metal will deposit and adhere. Chromo-sulfuric acid-based solutions are unfortunately toxic.
- After the etching step, the polymer surface is activated by means of a noble metal (i.e. palladium) and then metallized using electroless plating. Unfortunately, noble metals are rare and expensive.
The patent suggests to avoid both these problems making the polymer surface conductive by the superposition of a single or multiple layer of a pristine graphene material with null or limited non-carbon elements. Then a metal layer comprising a plated metal layer is deposited on the electrically conducting graphene and polymer surface. The quality of metal coating, mediated by the graphene sheet, can take a luxurious chrome look and exhibit superior abrasion resistance, barrier properties, heat radiation reflective properties, corrosion resistance, strength and hardness. The patent also discloses an apparatus that can be used to produce the surface-metalized polymer films.

## **Plastic on metals**
Much more common in use is the problem of deposing a polymer on a metallic surface. However, some applications e.g. metal dental prosthesis, bring additional constrains to make the procedure very challenging. Implanted material is seen as “foreign body” by the living system, trigging an inflammatory response and a rejection of the implant. Promising polymeric prosthetic materials have been developed to allow the osteointegration of implants. They are made by “bioactive polymers” intended to reduce fibro-inflammatory issues. [7] proposes a direct grafting process wherein the polymer is grafted directly onto the surface of metal, without any intermediate molecule as anchor point. The technique comprises the following steps:
- The metallic surface is activated by acid and oxidizing bath of H2O2, where hydroperoxide groups (-OOH) are generated in a control manner
- Active donor species of free radicals are generated by UV irradiation (power 162 mW/cm2 for less 90 minutes) in presence of a biocompatible monomer (e.g. sodium styrene sulfonate)
- The biocompatible polymer is formed by addition of other acrylic/methacrylic monomers in an oxygen free environment.

## **Fiber composite using thermoplastic polymers**
Fiber composites are commonly made by impregnating fibers with low viscous thermosetting monomers/oligomers. The following thermal crosslinking makes a three-dimensional structure that hardens the material permanently. Example of thermosetting prepolymers are unsatured polyesters, vinyl esters, epoxy and phenolic ones. A major disadvantage is the matrix rigidity and the impossibility of recycling. Thermoplastic polymers do not present these disadvantages, but they are too viscous for fiber impregnation even at high temperature or solution. [8] (1) and [9] (2) offer a solution made by the mixture: 
- Methacrylic polymer (mw > 50000 g/mol in (1) and < 100000 in (2))
- Methacrylic monomer
- Peroxide initiator (only in (1))
Used in a correct dosage, the mixture is able to completely wet the fibrous substrate (preferably mineral glass fibers). The thermoplastic composite material has satisfying mechanical properties such as high stiffness and a young modulus of at least 15 GPa. Under recycling, the polymeric material is partially recovered. Any special manufacturing process is available for the use of the new composite material.

## **Membranes made by thermoplastic and water-soluble polymers**
A membrane is a thin, semipermeable structure capable of separating two fluids or separating molecular and/or ionic components or particles from a liquid. A membrane acts as a selective barrier, allowing some particles, substances or chemicals to pass through, while reining others. Many separations use membranes (osmosis, filtration) and all require high water resistance in combination with vapor permeability. The traditional material is expanded PTFE with subsequent bidirectional stretching, but it is under investigation for environmental concerns. [10] proposes a thermoplastic polymeric membrane, having pores with an average diameter < 2000 nm, and a new production process. In a new imprinting polymerization method, the process starts to produce a film by a thermoplastic and a water-soluble polymer. As soon as the film is shaped, the water-soluble polymer is removed obtaining a porous membrane. The patent covers a large variety of polymer combinations: preferred thermoplastic polymers are polyurethanes and preferred water-soluble polymers are polyvinylpyrrolidones and polyethylene oxides.

## **High performance polymer and carbon nanotube composite**
Poly ether ketone (PEK) and Poly - 2,5 benzidazole (ABPBI) belong to the family of high performance semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymers used in injection molded production of articles for high quality applications. The blend has a reasonable processability and superior performance in chemical resistance, temperature stability and low moisture absorption. However, the blend has not the required high electrical conductivity and tends to deform at low temperature (HDT – heat deflection temperature). [11] finds a solution by adding multi wallet carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) between 0.5 and 5 wt %. Polymers and nanotubes are mixed in a dry powder blend, the blend is extruded to obtain granules followed by injection molding for the preparation of useful articles. The HTD growths up to 170-240 C and the storage modulus still remains very high (150-400 MPa at 300 C). To avoid agglomeration MWCNT fibers are pre-treated by ultra-sonification and later blended with the polymeric granules (0.1 10 micron).
[12] mechanically disperses MWCNT in epoxy resin precursors. The dispersion is enough stable to coat different kind of surfaces. He claims that only a special three roll mill, described in [13], provides enough shear rate (above 1 x107 1/s) to break the strong nanotube interactions.

## **Antimicrobial composites**
Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is a preferred skin antiseptic over tinctures of iodine, iophors and alcohol. It is a substituted diguanidine salt with a high degree of antimicrobial activity, low mammalian toxicity and the ability to bind to the stratum corneum layer of skin and to mucous membranes. Articles with antimicrobial properties are largely request in sanitary applications but unfortunately, CHG cannot be processed at high temperature and above 40 C decomposes giving the toxic p-chloroaniline. [14] releases a process where CHG is chemically bounded with an acrylic adhesive precursor and later fixed on a polymeric film by radiation curing. All the process is done at ambient temperature and CHG can be probably entrapped in the film formation. The author does not explain if the CHG is chemically or physically bonded to the substrate.

## **Nanocellulose polymer composite**
[15] releases composition and process for a composite made by a hydrophobic polymer together with a nanocellulose -lignin material. Unutilized lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks have the potential to be much cheaper than petroleum as well much better from an environmental life-cycle assessment. Lignocellulosic biomass normally comprises primarily cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The first two are natural polymers of sugar and the last one is an aromatic/aliphatic hydrocarbon polymer reinforcing the entire biomass network. It is desirable to separate from the biomass the cellulose, as nano fibrils and crystals, and the lignin. Then, both components form a masterbatch by extrusion or pelletization. The patent describes a whole multistep process where:
- after separation by mineral acid, the hemi-cellulosic and lignin fraction is fermented and reduced to sugars and repolymerized in a whole polymer structure
- the cellulose-rich fraction is instead blended with a hydrophobic synthetic polymer
- both parts recombine in a single composite pellet, that is some examples is 100% renewable.

## **Repelling animal polymer composite**
Cables, such as power transmission, telephone, optical fiber cables, are used to transmit electricity /signal /data over distance. Rodents have been known to chew on cables and cause their failure. [16] proposes a protective material based on a multistep procedure. The method of preparing the aversive additive involves infusing an aversive material into an encapsulant, depositing a protective material around the encapsulant and compounding the aversive additive with a polymer. More precisely:
- Encapsulants are formed from a cell (e.g. yeast cell) from which the cellular contents have been eluted.
- The aversive material will trigger a flavor, olfactory or tactile response in the animal, so suggested materials are: cinnamaldehyde, wintergreen oil, capsaicin, peppermint oil, etc. It is fed to encapsulant by infusion.
- The protective material is a negatively charged component including: polyacrylic acid, ialuronic acid, sodium alginate and polystyrene sulphonate. Sometimes a layer-by layer deposition is performed using positively charged polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (PDADMAC) and negatively charged polyacryliacid (PAA) sodium salt.
- The polymer is taken from a broad variety of materials including thermoplastic, and thermoset polymers. A preferred material is medium density polyethylene (MDPE) and the compound is made by extrusion.

## **PVA mixture as support in 3D printing**
3D printing process requires the deposition of drops of melted thermoplastic polymer. Certain structures like hollow sections cannot be built directly and first need a support structure printed on or around the final structure from the thermoplastic polymer is build. The support structure is prepared from a printable polymer which can be removed by thermal or solvent treatment after the final structure is made. Several thermoplastic polymers are already discovered as support polymer such as waxes, polyethylene glycol, high impact polystyrene, polylactic acid or hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose. [17] covers the use of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) because is a thermoplastic material with a broad melting range and can be easily removed from the final printed structure by dissolving in alkaline solution. PVA is mixed with polar polymers to improve the adhesion to the thermoplastic persistent material. Polar polymers are selected in a wide list including polylactic acid, polyvinyl butyral and polycaprolactone in a range between 5 to 50 wt%.
