Foam blow molding consists of using chemical or physical foaming additives with thermoplastic polymer pellets in an extrusion process. Chemical blowing agents are substances that releases gas upon high temperate conditions. Physical additives are inert gas such as Nitrogen or Carbon Dioxide. The extruder creates a single-phase fluid that is homogeneous while under the high temperature and pressure with the extruder. Upon exiting the ambient environment at the die tip, the sudden drop in fluid pressure results in the gas coming out from the melt and forming gas-filled cells. The cells ideally growth spherically and remain individual, yet numerous, as the extruded material is delivered in the mold and formed into its ultimate shape. The tendency of switch from chemical to physical blowing agents seems confirmed by [1]. They propose to feed the blowing agent (Nitrogen or Carbon Dioxide) in a new extruder hopper. The hopper feeds the polymeric material and, through a pressurized vessel, the gaseous blowing agent. In this way a better control, a complete mixing and a precise dosage are all achieved at the same time. The pressure level of the vessel is integrated in the electronic controller on board of the extruder. Processing techniques of injection or blow molding are discontinuous. The screw may stop rotating after a charge of a new polymer or during the injection into a mold. Conventional blowing agent delivery systems inject instead blowing agent continuously and may lead to an uneven distribution of the blowing agent in the polymer melt. The production of microcellular foams is adversely affected if the blowing agent is not precisely controlled. A trial solution is positioning a valve close to the blowing agent port in the extruder and discontinuously introducing the gas. The frequent opening and closing of the valve, however, may limit the lifetime and precision of the delivery system. [2] has found an efficient solution to this problem. The gas is delivered from the source to the extruder by a flow restrictor and the pressure is measured and regulated at the entrance of the restrictor and only measured at the end. Blowing agent is introduced into the polymer when the pressure upstream to the restrictor is greater than the pressure downstream. If the downstream pressure is less, as it happens when the screw is stopped, the flow of blowing agent is null.
[3] relates to an extrusion process for the production of expandable vinyl aromatic polymer (e.g. styrene) adopted in thermal isolation. It is generally known that addition of athermanous fillers of heat absorbers (e.g. carbon black), heat scatterers (e.g. silica and titanium oxides) and heat reflectors (e.g. aluminum pigment and graphite) decreases the thermal conductivity of polymer. However, the presence of athermanous fillers often leads to a deterioration of the fire self-extinguishing and mechanical properties of the polymer foam. This problem is solved by an extrusion process for the production of expandable vinyl aromatic polymer granulate, comprising: a previous separate pre-mixing of each components with a quote of the vinyl aromatic polymer, followed by a granulation by extrusion. A preferred type of each re-mixing is a co-rotating twin-screw extruder (32D/40 mm with 2-to 6 mixing elements). Because of the separate addition each component, including the propellant, the process is highly flexible and allows for the processing of additives that have very different processing requirements. [5] increased the compatibility of polymer and filler proposing a calcinated anthracite pretreated with silane and siloxane on the surface.
Separate ingredient feeds although make the process more complex eliminate unwanted interactions, e.g. those between catalysis and additives. [6] exactly deals with this problem in the polyurethane foam reactions. Polyurethane foams have advantageous physical and mechanical properties but they are highly flammable and a complete pyrolysis can occur. Expandable graphite is formed from crystalline graphite flakes, which are intercalated with an expanding agent, such as sulfuric acid. When heated suddenly the sulfuric acid reacts with the carbon to form a blowing agent, which force the crystalline graphite apart expanding the structure a hundred times over. The expandable graphite is low density and non-flammable and acts as thermal heat shield insulating the underlying polyurethane foam and smothering any flame inside the foam. Therefore, conventional polyurethane foams incorporate expandable graphite as a flame retardant and premix graphite in the polyols feed. Unfortunately, the sulfuric acid included with the graphite is highly reactive with polyols and catalysts also dissolved. The effect is a decreased foam rise time and a reduced heat of polymerization. The patent suggests to split the polyol feed in at least two parts: one with dissolved graphite and the other with catalyst and other additives. All feeds are combined, in a controlled dispensing head, just before the extruder entry.
Polyurethane foams are also matter of [7], that focus on the possibility of increasing “airflow”. In some applications such as seating and bedding one often wants air to flow easily out of the foam when the foam is compressed and to re-enter the foam easily when the compressive force is released. The air bubbles made in the foam production are not enough big to provide this properties and large open cells in the foam are introduced via polymer polyols particles. These are round particles having multiple hydroxyl groups preformed and reticulated in the flexible polyurethane foam by the diisocyanates. Another main reason to incorporate polymer polyols particle is to increase load-bearing in resilient foam, i.e. the ability of the foam to support a compressive load. The patent synthetizes a styrene acrylonitrile copolymer in a continuous phase that includes one polyol like polypropylene oxide or polyethylene oxide polyols. The copolymer form particles with small controllable diameters that entangles polyols molecules.
It has long been desired to use reinforced high temperature plastic materials to replace metal in many articles especially in automotive industry. To be successful, the reinforced plastic material must have good mechanical properties and excellent dimensional stability, even at high temperatures. Weldlines (also known as knit lines see [8] ) are intrinsically weak parts is submitted to load in most injection molded articles of even moderate complexity. They are generated when two separate melt streams join either in multi-gated molds or a consequence of flow around obstacles. The development of many interesting productions has been hampered by poor weldline strength. [9] releases a polymer composition having an improved balance in mechanical properties at elevated temperature and mechanic strength at weldline. The invention consists: 19 a semi-crystalline sei-aromatic polyamide (SSPA); 2) a reinforcing agent, such as a glass or carbon fiber; 3) one or more additives (flame retardant, plasticizer, dye). The molded part with improved high temperature resistance may be an automotive part, for example a load bearing part or an engine part, or a part of electronic device, for example a part of housing or a frame.
[10] releases composition and process to make rigid polymer foams suitable for high temperatures in the presence of moisture and high pressure such as in automotive engines. The foam is made by adding a standard polyol to a poly isocyanate component with polyimide groups and at least one Lewis base. The polyisocyanates is made by condensation of a polyisocyanate (e.g. MDI) with anhydrides of poly carboxylic acids such as the trimellitic anhidryde or pyromellitic dianhydride after carbon dioxide release. Further gas is generated by the reaction of water with the isocyanate to form a carbamic acid that eliminates CO2 to generate an amine. The CO2 elimination is catalyzed by the Lewis base and provides the polymer foams rapidly and without addition of blowing agent. The amine-functional component present in the mixture and the isocyanate groups combine to form urea groups, while the hydroxyl of polyol form urethane groups with isocyanates. The polyurethane-polyurea polymer network reach a compressive stress at 10% relative deformation not less than 180 kPa.
Poly meth acryl imide (PMI) foams are widely used in composite material for light weight design in the aerospace, automotive, sport and medical device industries due to their light weight, high specific strength /modulus and high distortion temperature (80-240 C). PMI foam is the optimal core material of the sandwich structure but its formation and moldability is under study [11]. [12] suggests a method by combining PMI particles with a thermoplastic resin and melt together by extrusion before molding covered by [13]. The combination forms a flowable melt at temperatures at least 120 C higher than the glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic polymer. The helpful effect of the thermoplastic that acts as a solvent, allows the extrusion and molding of articles with complex geometries impossible to obtain in alternative ways.
Polyethylene foams are utilized in footwear components as sole and midsole applications. Crosslinked ethylene-based polymers including ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) copolymers have traditionally dominated this market since they can easily be foamed with a chemical blowing agent. But cross-linked ethylene-based polymers are not recyclable and cannot be splintered because they are thermoset and not thermoplastic. [14] proposes a mixture of ethylene-based copolymers that are not cross-linked and consequently fully recyclable. The components: ethylene/alpha-olefin multiblock copolymer made by hard (ethylene) and soft (e.g. octene) segments and a standard LDPE, are pre-modified by melting together with a peroxide (e.g. t-butyl peroxide) in an extruder. After the addition of a physical blowing agent (e.g. carbon dioxide in supercritical conditions) foam bids are produced with a very low density (0.3 g/cm3), but high strength (30 cN). The footwear soles are later modelled by hot sintering.
