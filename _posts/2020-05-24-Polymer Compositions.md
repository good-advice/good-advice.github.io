## **Dynamic cross-linked polymers**
Thermoset polymers have superior dimensional stability, mechanical, thermal and environmental resistance and are irreplaceable in many demanding, but cannot be reshaped and reprocesses by heat or with solvent. In contrast thermoplastics, when heated can flow which permits extrusion, injection and molding of articles. The key is to design the chemistry so that at high temperature, exchange reactions enable stress relaxation and malleability and upon cooling, the exchanges become so slow that the topology of the network is essentially fixed [1]. Transesterification as an exchangeable reaction is an equilibrium process, where the exchange between ester and alcohol creates a new pair of ester and alcohol through the alkoxy moiety interchange. [2], [3], [4] and [5] disclose methods of forming dynamic cross-linked polymers in a batch process using functional chain extenders. The aim is to dynamically cross-linked polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) for electronic and automotive applications improving process yield and reducing cost on an industrial scale. Butylene terephthalate oligomers are proposed in a two steps process with a straight control of the carboxylic acid end groups (10-60 mmol/kg) and the intrinsic viscosity (0.7-1.2 dl/g). The compound is then used in a conventional polymer forming process, such as compression molding, profile extrusion, injection molding or blow molding to form the articles.

## **Biodegradable polymer for therapeutic applications**
Synthetic peptidic drugs are efficient in cancer therapy since show high specificity, but they require high dosage if they are not delivered exactly into the cytosol of cancerous cells. [6] provides a biodegradable block copolymer in a form of nanoparticles used as carriers for various agents, including therapeutic and targeting agents. The patent covers several polymers essentially made by a polylactic acid (PLA) and hydrophilic-hydrophobic block copolymers from synthetic origin. Among them, authors focus on the block copolymer of PLA with a polyethylene glycol- polypropylene glycol- polyethylene glycol (PEG-PPG-PEG). Limits are given on the molecular weight of the polymer to make particles with a size in the range of 30-120 nm. The therapeutic agent can be surface-conjugated or adsorbed on the biodegradable nanoparticles. The preparation starts dissolving PLA and PEG-PPG-PEG in an organic solvent together with a carbodiimide (DCC - N, N dicyclohexylcabodiimide) and leaving the coupling reaction takes place (20-30 hours). Then, the mixture is dissolved in water without the need of any emulsifiers, where particles of the required size are formed. The nanoparticles are amphiphilic in nature and may load hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs in relevant amount due to the absence of emulsifiers.

## **Fracture resistant polymers**
A material with high fracture toughness is well suited for use in ticker walled parts e.g. machine components, pipes and casings. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a common material for many commercial applications because it is high crystalline and has outstanding chemical resistant properties. Both properties are needed in the electronic industry for components of mobile phones, tablets, etc. together with a good fracture toughness. Fracture toughness measures the energy required to propagate a crack through a test bar until the bar breaks. The propagation of a crack requires less energy in brittle than in ductile materials. [7] proposed a detailed procedure for a nucleophilic polycondensation of one or more bisphenols with one or more organic dihalide compounds, in the presence of sodium or potassium carbonates solubilized in an aromatic sulfone. The presence of organic dihalide compounds as residual impurities in the resulting polymer is minimized by a long termination step at high temperature (up to 320 C) gradually reached in the course of the reaction. The molecular weight is monitored by measuring the torque of a stirrer motor driving paddle in the reaction mixture which has been previously calibrated.

## **Laurolactam polyamide with low yellowing**
Laurolactam is a macrocyclic lactam used as a monomer in engineering plastics, such as nylon 12 and copolymers. Its use is mainly for covering cables and insulating material, while in automotive is used in oil and gasoline resistant tubes. However, it is used also as matting agent in cosmetic (body powder and skin creams) where a white color is required. [8] proposes a new process for monomer and polymer production which show lower yellowing compared to the prior art. It uses a standard method for the monomer synthesis (a Beckmann rearrangement of cyclododecanone oxime to give lauro-lactam in the presence of a catalyst), but introduces a purification to remove impurities before making the polymerization. It has been found that the presence of cyclic substance having 24 carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom (oxygen or nitrogen) and having a molar mass between 300 and 380 g/mol affects the color of the polymer. Impurities are generated as secondary reaction in the monomer preparation, can be easily detected by spectrometry (GC-MS) and removed by crystallization or distillation with at least five theoretical plates.

## **Polyamides with high melting point or high molecular weight**
Semi aromatic polyamides with high melting points are commercially requested but are difficult to produce. It is known in the art that as the molar concentration of terephthalic acid increases in a polyamide, the melting point of the polyamide increases as well. However, as the melting point of the polyamide increases in solution polymerization, the temperature must be increased in order to keep the viscosity low. This causes several problems including a decomposition of the polymer itself before a valuable molecular weight is reached. [9] finds a solution splitting the production in two parts: a polymerization of a polyamides with a standard composition of aromatic acids; a second polymerization of short oligomers amine terminated, made almost exclusively by terephthalic acids. The two polymers are later joined in a reactive extrusion at 350-380 C that last no more than 4 minutes. The process supplies a product with a required molecular weight and a tunable melting point above 300 C.
[10] proposes high molecular polyamide 6/66 copolymers. Interestingly, he utilizes cyclic oligomers analog of caprolactam, such as cyclic dimers and higher analogs(C3-C9). The compounds are unwanted by-products that are formed during the production of PA6 and PA6/66 copolymers. In fact, after the usual polymerization the cyclic oligomers are removed by a leaching process. The inventor found that cyclic oligomers react with diamine at elevated temperature (260 C) to ring-open the cycle oligomers to produce amide-prepolymers that are end capped with amine groups. The prepolymers are then reacted with a diacid to form the 6/66 copolymers with a very high molecular weight (2-4.5 relative viscosity by ISO307:2007).

## **Polymer with urethane and thiouretane groups**
Since polyurethanes are important industrial polymers, there is a demand to find process without the need of toxic isocyanates. [11] discloses radically polymerizable compounds with a cyclic five membered carbonate ring system (alkylidene-1,3-dioxolan-2-one). Urethanes groups are formed by reacting these compounds with diamine species. [12] broads the concept including mono thiocarbonate (MTC) instead of a simple carbonate. An MTC is a compound with one five-membered cyclic MTC group, i.e. a ring system with 5 atoms three of them are from MTC, -CO(=O)-S-, and the remaining two members are carbons, closing the cycle. They may have a molecular weight from 104 up to 100.000 g/mol. The polymerization conditions are similar to those used for the known carbonates and the polymers seem to have different properties. Patents do not cover any specific application but claim a better thermal resistance than traditional polyurethanes.

## **Bioactive polymer: imidazolium macromolecules**
Design of novel imidazolium -based polymers [13] remains as an exciting field since their ability to bond to metal as a ligand. The polymeric nature inherits almost all the properties of its structural unit, well known from ionic liquids. Such properties are tunable via varying anions without changing the polycation main chain and can serve a broad range of applications (cosmetic, pharma and electronic). It is not surprising though that [14] releases a method of preparing polymeric imidazolium compounds without monoaldehyde and the related problems of an expensive purification. The process starts from an alpha-dicarboxylic compound, an oligo amine, a protic acid and less than 1 mol of a mono-aldehyde, reacted with one another. Polymers of high molecular weight (ca 13000 g/mol) are produced but with broad distribution (polydispersity > 5).

## **Urea-urethane thickeners**
Urea-urethane polymers are generally prepared by a two steps procedure where in the first step a monohydroxyl compound is reacted with a diisocyanate to give a monoisocyanate adduct; and in the second step the adduct is combined with a diamine in the presence of a lithium salt and solvent. [15] proposes one of these polymers as thixotropic rheology modifier in paint and coating formulations. He observes that if the monohydroxyl compound (preferred are: butyltriglycol, 2-ethylhexanol and methoxy polyethylene glycol) is in molar excess (up to 1:1.5%) to the isocyanate (preferred is toluene isocyanate) the isocyanate still remains monosubstituted. This allows the further combination of adducts with diamines and reduces the viscosity of the adduct compound since the excess of monohydroxyl compound acts as solvent. This simple observation avoids unnecessary isocyanate distillation and the addition of further organic solvents.

## **Polymeric suspending agent for nanoparticles in lubricants**
The effect of lubricant to reduce the friction between surfaces is sometime achieved to the use of solid inorganic nanoparticles (such silica and titration dioxide). The challenging problem is to stably suspend such particles in an organic solvent without agglomeration and sedimentation even when heat and shear forces stress the lubricant in use. Literature shows that polymers can be added to the surface via surface-initiated polymerization. A small molecule is first reacted with the particle surface and then a polymer is built from it. One problem of this method is that cross-linking is likely to occur at high monomer conversions because of the high density of reactive sites on the particle surface. [16] solves the problem attaching on the surface a preformed comb polymer, i.e. ester of methacrylic acid with a hydroxylated hydrogenated polybutadiene (Mw = 500-1000 g/mol). The backbone of the polymer is formed by the interlinked unsatured groups of the methacrylic esters. The alkyl groups and the hydrogenated polybutadiene chains form the side chains. The macromonomers can be prepared by transesterification of short chain methacrylates with hydroxylated hydrogenated polybutadienes (i.e. a macro-alcohol). Inorganic nanoparticles used in the example are hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoparticles with diameter between 5 and 100 nm.

## **Amphoteric and anionic polymeric flocculants**
To concentrate an aqueous solid suspension which are mineral in nature such china clay, gold, copper or nickel tailing, is widely used a polymeric flocculant. Aqueous suspensions are concentrated in a gravity thickener vessel in a continuous manner. Suspension and a water solution of flocculant are met in the middle of a vessel, the flocculated solid settle to the bottom to form a bed of solids, which tend to undergo consolidation at the lower end of the vessel. The water accumulates to the top of the vessel where increasing the clarity. The solid is withdrawn continuously by a mechanical device at the bottom and a clear solution is pump away from the top. Polymeric flocculants are evaluated by respect the combination of dosage, settling rate and overflow clarity. It is known that anionic polymers are efficient in clarity and rate and non-ionic polymers excel in low dosage. [17] finds the best compromise between two categories suggesting and amphoteric polymer made by:  a backbone of acrylamide and alternate groups of anionic monomers (AMPS – 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulphonic acid) and cationic monomers (e.g. quaternary ammonium salts of dimethyl amino acrylate). The water solution polymerization runs till the formation of a solid gel shown to be very efficient in the flocculation of china clays.
Anionic flocculants are instead requested in paper and paperboard manufacturing process. They help the agglomeration of bleached kraft hardwood and softwood when combined with a cationic flocculant. [18] rebalances the previous formulation to achieve an anionic polymer. The cationic monomer is then replaced by acrylic acid, but AMPS and acrylamide still remain in almost the same proportions. In this case, an inverse emulsion polymerization could be the preferred production method. [19] protects the application of using anionic flocculants of acrylamide/potassium acrylate copolymers (Mw from 5k to 5M g/mol) to recover hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the manufacture of fluorides and separation of uranium isotopes.

## **Polymeric flame retardants**
Brominated compounds are known to be highly effective as flame retardants and in many cases, they constitute the only viable option for reducing the fire risk of synthetic materials. It is postulated that the higher the molecular weight of the brominated compound, the lower is its volatility and its migration outside the plastic. So, the bio-accumulation in living tissue is reduced. [20] found that traditional brominated polystyrenes (BPS) can be used as flame retardants in impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), but the idea was completed in [21]. In fact, it discovers a novel class of high molecular weight polymers having pendent penta-bromo-benzyl groups (-CH2C6Br5), which are suitable retardants in many flammable materials (e.g. polyamide, polypropylene and HIPS and ABS). Low molecular weight compounds containing a penta-bromo-benzyl moiety are known in the art as pendant in acrylate polymers, but the patent largely expands the polymeric substrate. It found that the -CH2C6Br5 group can be incorporated into aromatic ring containing polymers via a Friedel-Craft alkylation. The composition includes polymers where the brominated group is in the form of the side chains (like in polystyrene) or as part of its backbone chain (like in poly phenyl ether). The flame-retardant polymers have a molecular weight preferably less than 3500 g/mol with a Bromine content not less than 60%. The Friedel-Craft alkylation starts from a penta-bromo-benzyl halide (Chlorine or Bromine) in an organic solution of the base polymer. The reaction use AlCl3 as a catalyst, runs between 60-90 C and generates hydrogen bromide. The end of the reaction is determined by gas chromatography on the reacting halide or by cessation of hydrogen bromide evolution.
[22] ideally completes the application of Bromine-polymeric retardant when they are used in expanded or extruded foam articles for insulation of buildings. For many years, hexa-bromo-cyclo-decane has represented the main flame retardant, used industrially by all the main self-extinguishing expandable polystyrene manufactures. Recently, it has been observed that carbon fillers used as athermanous agents significantly accelerates the brominate flame retardant degradation process, with the consequent release of significant quantities of hydrobromic acid. This is responsible for corrosion on the production plants with the consequent deterioration of the metal parts and the transformation characteristic of the expanded polystyrene. The patented solution is the use of a flame-retardant mixture instead of a single species. The mixture is: a non-polymeric brominated flame retardant, a polymeric flame retardant containing at least 50% bromine and a synergistic additive. The synergistic agent is defined as a substance able to generate radicals that induce the degradation of the halogenated flame retardant with the formation of halogen radicals at the flame temperature. Said additives may be peroxide (di-cumyl peroxide) or an unstable hydrocarbon (2,3 dimethyl 2,3 diphenyl butane).

## **High refractive polymers for optical applications**
A number of organic polymers have been developed as replacement for glass application such as optical lens, fiber optics, windows in nautical and aviation. They can provide advantages relative to glass, including shatter resistance, lighter weight, ease of molding and demolding and ease of dyeing. In ophthalmic applications, the use of polymeric materials with high refractive index require thin lens which is generally desirable. Moreover, preferred materials have a low adhesion to the interior of the glass molds during the casting process, leading articles with less defects. [23] releases a composition and process to produce polymers with high refractive index and ease demolding. Over a common although optimized polyurethane composition the invention focalizes on the addition of ionic fluoride and/or ionic fluoride precursors. The ionic fluoride is in the form of salt: potassium fluoride, cesium fluoride, tetrabutylammonium fluoride, etc. The fluoride precursor is a material capable of forming ionic fluoride in situ such as hexafluorosilicic acid and tris dimethylamino sulfonium difluorotrimethyl silicate. The fluoride materials can be added to the final organic polymerizable composition prior forming the articles. Patent also reviews several thermosetting organic polymers and indicates as best solution for transparent high refractive polymer a mixture of cycloaliphatic diisocyanates (e.g. H12MDI) and a polyol with MW < 500 g/mol (e.g. ethoxylated bisphenol A) and a polyol/polythiol containing both amine and hydroxyl functional groups (e.g. diethylene glycolamine).

## **Film forming and wash active polymers**
Portion wise packaged detergents and cleaners (mono-dose units) are manifold for easy handling and correct dosage. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film is used as packaging material since it dissolves at the start of washing process and releases ingredients that develop their effect. The biggest disadvantage of PVA is the inability to contribute to the washing performance. Some patents remedies to this introducing a copolymer made by a polyacrylic portion joined with an etho [24], [25] or etho–propoxylated [26] part. This is a film forming polymer soluble in water and able to act as a nonionic surfactant when fully solubilized. Patents adapts a radical solution polymerization method taken from literature [27] and covers several combinations of monomers and additives. A broad range of molecular weight 2000 – 100000 g/mol is considered.

## **Cationic thickener for detergency**
There is a steady demand for new and cheap thickeners for home and personal care cationic formulations (fabric softeners, dishwashing gels). Traditional thickeners are cross-linked cationic polymers made by inverse emulsion polymerization. [28] and [29] introduce a novelty because the product is made by two cationic polymers with different molecular weight so that their distribution is bimodal. The process provides the direct mixture and avoid coagulum formed if two different productions are simply mixed. The small molecular weight polymer (approximately 25 wt %) is water soluble and is linear. It works as anti-resoling agent and leaves the fibers clean of soil particles, such that graying has been minimized. By contrast, the high molecular weight part has a rather high amount of crosslink. It is almost insoluble in water and swellable in water acting as thickener. The polymerization is carried out in two subsequent steps. In the second step the cross-linker is completely absent and it is carried out after the end of first step.
