Many polyolefins are copolymers of ethylene with other monomers (e.g. hexene). With copolymers, not only the molecular weight distribution affects properties but also the composition. The different composition influences: extractable content, environmental stress crack resistance, heat sealing, impact, tear and strength resistance. Much effort has been placed in understanding how the comonomer is distributed along the polymer carbon chain. The composition distribution of an ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer refers to the distribution of comonomer as a distribution of short chain branches. When the distribution of short chain branches varies among the backbone, the polymer is said to have a Broad Composition Distribution (BCD) and if the amount of comonomer is similar among the molecules of different molecular weights, the composition distribution is said to be narrow (NCD). Recently a third distribution has been documented as Broad Orthogonal Composition Distribution (BOCD) in which the comonomer is incorporated predominantly in the high molecular weight chains. Catalysts influence the polymer composition. Polymers made with Ziegler-Natta catalysts give broad distribution, but the high molecular weight fractions are higher density (i.e. less comonomer) than the lower molecular weight (high comonomer). In contrast, metallocene catalysts typically produce polyolefin with an NCD. [1] and the following patents focus on the production of polymer with BOCD distribution. BOCD behavior has been associated with a good balance of mechanical and optical properties. For example, LLDPE films strive for a good balance of stiffness, toughness, optical properties (haze and gloss) and processability. Sealing performance, key property in films, is affected mainly by density, it improves as density gets lower, but density has the opposite effect of stiffness. There is an interdependence between molecular weight and comonomer distribution on sealing performance and BOCD is the optimal solution. [2] proposes a solution based on a combination of two specific metallocene catalysts and the method of their use. [3] includes the possibility to use an activator (alumoxane compound) to convert the neutral metal compound to a catalytically active metal cation. [4] defines the comonomer types: C3-C10 alpha-olefins and the temperature range: 10 to 75 C.
Composition control can be achieved by a physical blend of different polymers as suggested by [5] and [6]. Blending LLDPE with LDPE increases bubble stability in part due to the high melt strength (MS) of the LDPE and the increase of MS helps provide for an increase of film output. There is a need to control the composition monitored by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and find an optimized balance. Patents report equations useful to find a correct correlation between MS and blow film properties. [7] blends ethylene α-olefin elastomer (65-90 wt %) having no crystallinity with isotactic polypropylene (10-35 wt%) to reach the optimal MS for film and other application.
Composition control is key when polyolefins are used for special applications such as the coating of low voltage electrical cable, object of [7] work. Low Voltage Power cable operates at voltage below 6 kV. The conductor, typically copper, is coated with an insulation polyolefin layer by extrusion. Cables must resist to prolonged expose to wind and weather and the Oxygen Induction Time (OIT) is a good indicator of the resistance. OIT is a standardized measured of the time between melting and the onset decomposition in isothermal conditions (190-220 C) achieved by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The patent proposes a copolymer of ethylene and monomer with silane groups (VTES – vinyl trimethoxy silane, VTMS- vinyl trimethoxy silane) in the range of 0.5 to 3 wt %. Moreover, the copolymer must have a high molecular weight (express as MFR2 < 10 g/10 min) and limit the number of short oligomers unable to crosslink in the extrusion. The copolymer is made in a standard process of high-pressure polymerization in a tube reactor with multiple injection feeds. The high pressure (up to 4000 bar) is achieved by piston compressors that require the use of a lubricant. As known, lubricants (typically PAG- poly alkylene glycols) leak through the seals, mix with the monomers and participate to the reaction as CTA. The Patent observes the influence of lubricant on the hot set elongation of the polymer, i.e. the permanent elongation after storage a 200 C. Since an increase of elongation is detrimental for cable application, the inventor uses paraffinic hydrocarbons with MW lower than 480 as compressor lubricant, since their effect on the polymer is minimum.
Composition control is also a solution for LDPE onto paperboard extrusion laminations, where the advantage would be improved adhesion in the multi-layer structures, such as aseptic drink boxes, snack packaging, cheese packaging, etc. A good “fiber tear” adhesion is achieved when an adhesion between the polymer to the paper greater than the adhesion of the paper fiber to themselves. [8] claims that the optimal copolymer is made by ethylene with carbon monoxide (CO) having a content greater than 0 to less than 10 wt % CO on the whole polymer. Moreover, a low melt flow index (between 3 -30 g/10 minutes) guarantees the fastest speed in extrusion. Such kind of copolymers are made by a high-pressure polymerization of ethylene in a plug flow reactor with several injection points of CO along all the tube length.
