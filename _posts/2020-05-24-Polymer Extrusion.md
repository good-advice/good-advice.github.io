## **Polymeric polyphosphate additives in extrusion**
When the screw speed is increased, defects occur on the surface of the extruded material known as “orange peel” or “sharkskin”. Processing aids are used to improve the melt processing of polyolefins by reducing melt fracture but it is necessary that they do not lead to a deterioration in the physical properties of the extruded resin (mechanical properties, yellowing index, melt flow index). [1] finds a series of polymeric phosphites that avoid melt fracture and do not cause issues. Polyphosphites are achieved by a nucleophilic substitution in aromatic phosphite ethers (e.g. triphenyl phosphite) with polyglycols and alcohols (e.g. polypropylene glycols) [2]. Additives can be applied in many target applications such as: blow film, pipe, windows and door frame in limited amount (0.01-2 %). Comparatives examples show superior performance compared with common monomeric and oligomeric phosphites.

## **Porous article preparation**
Microporous membranes or hollow fibers are required in a wide spectrum of applications covering microfiltration and ultrafiltration, hemodialysis, batteries separators reverse osmosis pretreatment and food packaging. The standard preparation methods use precipitation of the polymer in a solvent (such as N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone or N, N-dimethyl formamide) followed by evaporation of the solvent that leaves cavities in the polymeric matrix. The use of solvent generates substantial environmental and disposal problems. [3] over passes these problems using a mixture of a film forming polymer and a water-soluble additive (not less than 28 wt %). The mixture is made in an extruder and mold into an article.  In contacting the article with water, the additive dissolves creating a pore network within the shaped article. Polymers tested are semi crystalline polymers like poly (phenylene sulfide) (PPS) and similar. A broad class of water-soluble additives are presented with preference for those that form a salt of sulfonic acid or carboxylic acid (e.g. Sodium benzenesulfonate, Sodium acetate).

## **Optimized additives for poly vinyl chloride extrusion**
[4] provides a new lubricant able to reduce the viscosity, fusion time and torque in the extrusion of poly vinyl chloride (PVC). Additives are used in the processing of PVC because it melts in a non-homogeneous mixture of fused powder with different micro-domains of un-fused particles of different size (from 1 to 150 micron) causing an extreme high friction in the extruder. Some fatty acid salts or esters are used as internal lubricants since they reduce the fusion temperature and then the viscosity. Other lubricants (external) such as paraffin or polyethylene waxes are instead able to migrate to the surface of the particles and reduce the friction on the metal and interface. The mixture of the two types of lubricants in a single masterbatch is not feasible since the high viscosity of the blend. The Patent overpass all these problems finetuning the composition of the mixture (balance between oxidized and non-oxidized hydrocarbons) and carefully selecting the molecular structure of each ingredients (carbon atom per molecules between 40 and 100 in a linear backbone of more 75 wt %).
[5] relates to uses of acrylic polymer additives in PVC extrusion to provide oriented polyvinyl chloride (o-PVC). The acrylic polymers are methyl methacrylate and C2-C6 alkyl methacrylate copolymers of at least 4M g/mol weight. o-PVC offers significant improvement over regular PVC in pipe production by maintaining burst and impact strength of the pipe while reducing its weight. To provide the o-PVC pipe, a regular pipe is extruded at half the desired final diameter and then stretched in the hoop direction to twice the original diameter. In doing so, the thickness of the pipe wall is also reduced by half, and the PVC chains align and orient, which increases the strength of the PVC material. Therefore, given a desired pipe diameter, an o-PVC pipe is half the weight and requires half the raw material of a regular PVC pipe, yet it maintains the same or better strength.

## **Grafting process with a low gel content**
Functionalized ethylene-based polymers are made from polyethylene (LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE) grafting on the backbone small amount (0.5-5 wt %) of maleic anhydride (MAH) by extrusion. The grafted functionality helps chemical interaction of the ethylene-based polymers to polar polymer like nylon, ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and inorganic fillers. The grafted functionality also increases the surface polarity of ethylene-based polymers to improve adhesion to paints and inks. Unfortunately, the methods used to make highly grafted ethylene-based polymers tend to have inherent process inefficiencies, resulting in low production rates and typically produce polymers with high gel levels. In a typical preparation, the two ingredients are premix with a radical initiator (peroxide or azo compound) for an extended period and fed to the extruder. Ideally, the mixture should be homogenously melted before the reaction take place. Often at least, some of the initiator is activated due to either the shear forces generated within the extruder or reaching the initiator activation temperature before a homogeneity and this, in turn, allows the polymer to cross-link as opposed to react with the MAH. Depending upon the nature and amount of gels in functionalized ethylene-based polymer, the polymer may be unacceptable for application. [6] finds a solution feeding the MAH and initiator just in the middle of the extruder (6th barrel over a total length 12 barrel for a twin-screw extruder L/D 1:48). Moreover, the use of the combination of a 3,4-diethyl-3,4 diphenyl hexane (DEDPH) and a 2,5 -dimethyl-2,5 -di (t-butyl peroxy) hexane (DBPH) is optimal because they decompose at different temperatures and with different kinetic. [7] combines the extrusion production of grafted ethylene-based polymers together with a polymer melt of pure ethylene coming directly from the polymerization reactor. The mixture is efficiently made by a static mixer before the production of pellets.

## **Extrusion of ultra-high molecular weight polyolefins**
Ultra-high molecular weight polymers (UHMW) are polymers with a molecular weight higher than 0.75M g/mol. They cannot be processed by common techniques because their poor fluidity. However, they have desirable properties including high tensile strength, a low coefficient of friction, high impact and abrasion resistance. [8] proposes a method to make them melt processable and injection moldable. The method includes a combination of applying a shear force to a polymer and heating the polymer. Initially a shear rate of at least 0.2 kw h/kg is applied to the UHMW at a temperature lower than its melting point. The polymer is transformed in a sheared polymer by an extruder (single, twin or triple screw) or mixer (turbo blender or granulator). Depending of the device, the step is called solid-state melt extrusion (SSME) or solid-state shear pulverization (SSSP). It is believed that applying a shear force to a polymer to form a sheared polymer, selectively cleaves very large chains but leaves shorter chains intact. In addition, free radicals generated during the process may react with shorter length polymers and thereby raise the overall number average molecular weight. Thus, the initial step lowers the average molecular weight (Mw) and raises the number average molecular weight (Mn), improving processability of the sheared polymer while improving tensile strength, impact resistance and toughness. The second step includes extruding the sheared polymer to form a processed polymer by heating it above its melting point. Here, both Mn and Mw decreases allowing the processed polymer to be useful for injection molding. The whole production can be performed in a single machine or two or more separated machines.
