## **Polyamides in plug flow reactor**
Although continuous process for polyamides production is known, many of the existing processes relate to batch operation. In a batch process, a water solution of diacids and diamine is polymerized in a cooled vessel, requiring large volumes of heat transfer fluid in the jacket to remove the reaction enthalpy. The rising polymer melt viscosity complicates water bubble formation, migration to the melt surface and steam disengagement which contributes to excessive foaming. In case of inefficient heat removal undesired polymer branching (gelling) is formed. [1] discovers that by concentrating the aqueous monomer solution by evaporation and continuously flowing it on the shell side of shell-and-tube reactor surprisingly provides a significant drop in the overall heat flux. This use of a plug flow reactor advantageously provides an overall heat efficiency, high conversion and low level of skin temperatures, foaming and branching. The reactor may be operated at a temperature from 200 to 300 C, pressure from 13.5 to 18 bar, conversion greater than 85% and residence time from 50 to 60 minutes. The patent also highlights the possibility for retrofitting an existing process. In this case, the existing reactor is in series between the evaporator and the new shell-tube reactor.
[2] couples a polyamide continuous production with a continuous compounding process. Since polyamides are frequently compounded with fillers, reinforcing agents and modifiers, the invention proposes of introducing the molten polyamide from the reactor directly to the extruder. No significant solidification is allowed to occur between the polymerization and the subsequent compounding. By introducing a polyamide feed already in molten form, additional extruder barrels, normally used for melting the resin, can alternatively be used for increasing vacuum exposure. This increased vacuum exposure in turn results in increased volatile impurity removal and a clearer product. Additional benefit resulting from applying vacuum in more zones is that the final pressure can be higher and a reduced cost of the vacuum apparatus. Locating the extruder less than 500 feet from the reactor output, the patent claims the compound at the lowest possible cost.

## **Conducting polymer in continuous flow reactors**
[3] and [4] disclose a continuous flow process for synthesizing polyaniline. Polyaniline is a conducting polymer that has attracted considerable attention for its environmental stability an because its conductivity can be reversibly controlled by oxidation/reduction or by protonation/deprotonation [5]. The key problem of its production is a narrow molecular weight distribution hardly achievable in batch reactors. The polymerization temperature has a strong effect on both the yield and the molecular weight of the polymer. They both decrease with increasing the reaction temperature. Batch synthesis problematically introduces an exothermic spike at start-up degrading the whole production. The patent proposes a tight temperature control (less than 3 C of variation) to avoid formation of low molecular weight polymers (not less than 30 monomer units). An excellent temperature control can be achieved using:
- Small scale reactors: 1 liter or less in case of stirred tank; 10 mm or less as diameter in case of plug flow reactor
- High mixing capability improved with the addition of static/dynamic mixers
- Diluted monomer solution (0.2 to 0.5 M)
- Short residence time (0.85 to 1.2 hour)
Reaction starts with an organic stream made by aniline converted in salt by a protonic acid (e.g. di nonyl naphthalene sulfonic acid) solubilized in a solvent such as an aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbon. An oxidant stream is made by dispersion of a free radical initiator (e.g. ammonium persulfate) in aqueous solution. Both streams are cooled down before joined in at least one mixing device and then send to a tube or a plate reactor.

## **Silylated polymers for coatings and sealants**
Silylated polymers are produced reacting a polyurethane prepolymer with a silylating agent (e.g. 3-isocyanoto propyl trimethoxy silane) in a tubular reactor with minimum back-mixing. It is important to reach high conversion because the unreacted monomer continues to react during storage changing the product viscosity and color. [6] provides compositions of tin-free formulations stable when moisture may be present. Instead, [7] introduces a stabilization step after silylation in the continuous process. The stabilization is managed with a scavenging package able to reduce all the residual NCO groups. Example of the substance used as terminators are caprolactam and vinyl trimethoxy silane. Patent provides plant details where the stabilization step is performed into static mixers, heat exchangers or in combination with other reaction steps in an effort of process intensification.
