## **Opaque Coating Compositions**
Powder coating compositions is a class of paints that are substantially dry, finely divided, free flowing, solid materials have gained considerable popularity in recent years over liquid coating for a number of reasons. Powder coatings are environmentally friendly materials since they are free of harmful volatile organic solvents and eliminates emission problems associated with liquid coating. Moreover, powder coating compositions are fully recyclable and reusable since the sprayed powders can be reclaimed and recombined with fresh powder feed. Powder coating compositions are finely divided particles of a polymer and a crosslinker in case of a heat radiation curable powder coating composition that also contains pigments, fillers and other additives. In a variety of applications such as white goods (e.g. fridges, washing machines, dishwashers) coating with matt finish are required or highly desirable. These formulations pose a series of challenges for the formulator such as poor physical storage stability of heat curable powder, inconsistency of the matting effect and too high dependency of the curing conditions. [1] provides a matt finish formulation by using only one heat-curable powder mixture (said 1K component) and not a physical blend of two different, separate and distinct heat-curable formulation (2K components). The use of just one component simplifies the coating application process, increases capacity of a line and reduces dramatically the costs for preparing coated articles with matt finish as liked by the end-customers. The author makes a choice of selected chemicals among a large number of ingredients, such as: 
- primer polyester (e.g. tri mellitic anhydride and cyclohexene oxide)
- copolymerizable polyester (i.e. with an excess of carboxylic groups internal to the backbone)
- cross-linker with at least two 3-hydroxyalkylamide groups.
- Standard matting agent (e.g. titanium dioxide).

Very important is also provide a powder with controlled and uniform particle size (<180 nm) to increase the storage stability of the final product maintain the cure temperature below 255° C.
Opaque effect is also required in liquid paints, where the pigment is suspended in water together with a polymeric binder that converts in a solid film after application to a substrate in a thin layer. Titan dioxide (TiO2) is frequently used to provide opacity besides whiteness in water-borne coating compositions. It was found that the opacifying capacity is a function of the spacing between the particles of the pigments in the dried applied coating. This capacity is maximized when the light scattering of the particle is maximum. This happens when the particles have a certain diameter and spacing, so that the light scattering capability of each particle does not interfere with the light scattering capability of its neighboring particles. This condition occurs in coating containing sufficiently low level of TiO2 such that the individual particles are isolated from each other. But such low level of TiO2, however, does not provide sufficient whiteness and hiding at typical dried coating thicknesses. Achieving the desired levels of whiteness requires high levels of TiO2 and a consequent close proximity of the particles on the surface. In short, the efficiency of the TiO2 as opacifying pigment is reduced when the particles are not homogeneously dispersed in the coating composition. Particles tend to agglomerate upon film formation and drying. It has been discovered that the spacing among particles can be improved by adsorbing a polymer latex on the surface of TiO2 particles. [2] designs a binder made by an emulsion polymerization of acrylic and methacrylic esters with styrene. The procedure to produce this binder is carefully detailed. It starts with a styrene seeded polymerization and alternate additions of acid monomer (e.g. methacrylic acid) are superimposed to a continuous feed of the other monomers (e.g. methacrylic esters). The binder is able to adsorb on the TiO2 particles without the need of phosphorous containing monomers as reported in literature.
[3] avoids agglomeration of TiO2 particles coating them by a thermoplastic polymer. The polymer is melted in an extruder together with the inorganic particles. It is interesting to note that the water dispersion is made in the extruder itself by pumping water gradually. A concentrated dispersion is obtained for future incorporation in the water-based varnish.
A polymeric matte dispersion suitable as a clear top coat for leather is described in [4]. The aqueous dispersion of polymeric microspheres (60% dry content - diameter between 1 and 25 microns) remains stable and flowable only if the particle size distribution is narrow. In fact, particles with reduce size (below 500 nm) promote the formation of gel. The dispersion is made by a seed polymerization of standard acrylic monomers and esters. The key finding of the Patent is the use of some reactive surfactants belong to the class of either a nonionic or anionic polyalkylene oxide salt of a distyryl or tristyril phenol.
Finally, [5] does not attributes too much importance to the polymer composition (polystyrene, polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate can be equally used) versus the relevant aspect of the surface roughness. It proposes a diluted polymer solution (2 w t%) with water and a volatile organic solvent such as acetone, ethyl acetate or chloroform. Preferred molecular weights of the polymer are in the range of 120 000 to 200 000 g/mol with narrow distribution. A film is formed by spraying in cold condition (15 C) and evaporating solvent between 20 to 40 C. The white conditions are achieved if the porous film has a microstructure comprising a plurality of interconnected nodes which have and average diameter of 150 to 1000 nm and a plurality of rod-shaped elements (rod like) having an average diameter of at least 40 nm and length of at least 700 nm.

## **Varnish with high solvent stability and low tendency to soiling**
A common effort is to find coating with high solvent stability and low tendency to soiling or elevated resistance to staining. [6] proposes a varnish made by a polymeric water dispersion. The dispersion is produced by a water polymerization in the presence of a carboxylic reach polymer particles, previously synthetized. The polymer particles increase their size by the addition of the new forming polymer on the surface. High solid content and considerable particle size (ca 650 nm) are obtained. The varnish is then sprayed on the surface and tested. Limited tests made only on ethanol and coffee show a superior performance versus reference products.
[7] moves to the same goal working on the physical properties of the polymer surface of plastic household appliances. Altering the surface structure of a polymer substrate allows variation of the surface properties. By creating micro-scale and nanoscale structures the hydrophobicity of a surface changes as such that it becomes highly water repellent. Since microorganisms live in the water, a water-repellant surface is safer. Inspired by the structure of lotus leaves, the patent proposes a surface covered by micro-pillars high between 5 to 15 micron and distant less than 1 micron. The surface is imprinted by a Thermal Nanoprint Lithography (Th-NIL). Th-NIL is a mechanical forming technique that physically molds deformable material into a desired shape. The method is applicable to the most common thermoplastics.
A more drastic approach is utilized by [8]. Fluoro-acrylate and silane monomers are sprayed and surface-polymerized by plasma radiation. Inventors claim not only the hydrophobic effect of the polymer but also physical repulsion due to the multi-stacked nanostructure of the polymeric layer.

## **Compact Process coating for automotive**
Traditional automotive paint process requires up to five layers, each followed by a heating cured period. Each layer provides a specific function such as chip resistance, UV opacity, substrate smoothing, coloring, etc. The tendency in the last decade is to reduce the number of intermediate bake and cured cycles and so the energy, cost and complexity while maintaining high level of optical quality and appearance. The general name given to such modified paint processes is “Compact Process”. [9] proposes a two steps process based on water-based core-shell particles and a cross-linker. The polymer core of the particles is made by at least 20% of vinyl ester and amides of carboxylic acids and lactams. Such high level contributes to the smoothness and chip resistance of the resulting composite coating. The core may be internally crosslinked through the use of monomers (up to 10%) having multiple double bonds such as glycol di methacrylate. The shell is designed to be more polar using monomers having hydroxyl and acid groups able to undergo a later external reticulation. The second layer in the procedure is made by a more traditional polyester, polyacrylate or polyurethane. The crosslinking agent includes poly isocyanates, polyacids and anhydrides able to react with the high variety of hydroxyl groups on the surface when the temperature reaches 140 C.

## **Low shrinkage polyisocyanurates**
Processes known of polyisocyanurate plastics from monomeric aliphatic di isocyanates (e.g. HDI 1,6 -di isocyanato hexane) have the fundamental disadvantage that a considerable shrinkage in volume occurs in the course of a trimerization reaction, which can present problems particularly in the casting of bodies of defined geometry and in film protection. [10] protects the idea of preforming the aliphatic polyisocyanurates and produce the film using the polyisocyanurate together with a small amount (20 wt %) of monomeric diisocyanates. The comparatively low monomeric isocyanate produces less heat of reaction and facilitates the production of large-volume. Preformed aliphatic polyisocyanurates are achieved as a modification of the isocyanate synthesis and are a mixture of several coupling structures (uretdione, isocyanurate, allophanate, biuret, iminooxadiazinedione and oxadiazinetrione).

## **Radiation Curing**
[11] proposes new initiators and process conditions for the photo-polymerization of epoxides and polyols. It combines UV-induced cationic photo-initiators together with a thermal frontal polymerization. Important advantages of the cationic UV-cure systems are: improved adhesion due to the low shrinkage of film (less than 2-5%), low viscosity reactants, solvent-free formulations and high production rate. However, photo-induced polymerizations are limited to thin layer articles since the light has a limited penetration. The addition of a selected thermal initiator allows to start a frontal polymerization that makes possible to cure thick samples of epoxy monomers [12]. The coating of optical fibers and fabrication of printed circuit boards may have a beneficial impact. When the reaction is carried out using the combination of a cationic photo-initiator and a thermal free radical initiator, the initial irradiation with UV-light triggers a reaction cascade. A front will develop at the interface between the polymers which have already been generated and the monomers which have not yet been reacted; as long as sufficient heat is related to decompose the thermal initiator activates the cationic initiator and new cationic polymerization reactions will continue. If the two initiators are available in sufficient amounts, this front will propagate through the entire mixture which is to be polymerized, until the polymerization tops due to the lack of further unreacted monomers. The patent achieves this aim by the use of standard cationic UV-curable photo initiators (es diaryliodonium salts) and a benzo pinacol (tetra phenyl ethylene diol – TPED) derivate as thermal initiator.
A new photocurable material is presented by [13]. Achieved by grafting an organo-siloxane on a polyvinyl alcohol backbone the curable material has good film forming properties, transparency and solubility in organic solvent. In short, the invention makes curable the polyvinyl alcohol already widely used in films, sheets and containers. When radically curable organo-siloxanes graft polyvinyl alcohol, the crystallinity of the polymer is lowered, the solubility in organic solvents increases and the reactivity with modifying agents becomes higher, so that the new material becomes inexpensive and excellent. The grafting is made possible preparing first an organo-poly siloxane containing an isocyanate group. The hydroxyl groups of the polyvinyl alcohol are then effectively reacted with the previously prepared siloxane.
Photocurable polymers have found new applications in the lithographic process for the photofabrication of three-dimensional (3D) printing, especially in biomedical applications such as “Lab-on-Chip” [14]. In general, lithographic processes involve the use of UV light to locally cure a polymer at specific locations in superimposed layers to form 3-dimensional articles. Photocurable polymers are liquid at room temperature and easy to use in a printer, but the articles have moderate mechanical properties and thermal stability. [15] tends to fill this gap by a functionalized poly aryl ether sulfone (PAES). The polymer backbone such as a poly biphenyl ether sulfone is prepared by condensation in presence of a base (4,4’-dihydroxy biphenyl bi phenol and 4,4’-dichlorodiphenyl-sulfone). The polymer is then functionalized by addition of an alpha olefin (1-10 carbons) at least at one terminal of the molecule. The olefin comes from an halogenate compound (e.g. 4-bromo -1 butene) able to replace the hydroxyl ends, in organic solvent substitution. This application is probably part of a broader strategy of introducing PAES as block copolymer in many applications including reactive extrusion as proposed by [16].
