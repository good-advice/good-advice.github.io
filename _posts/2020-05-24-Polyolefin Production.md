## **Optimal amount and type of condensing agents**
There is a need and desire to increase production rates while maintaining the continuity of the microstructure properties (molecular weight, branching, composition, etc.) in a continuous process of gas polyolefin production. [1] and  [2] face this problem in a fluidized bed process and focalizes on the use of condensing agents. The condensing mode of operation in a fluidized bed reactor significantly increases the production rate by providing extra heat removal capacity through the evaporation of condensates in the cycle gas. Additional condensation is achieved by adding an inert condensing agent (ICA) into the reactor. ICA is a hydrocarbon with such as propane, isobutane or isopentane and their mixtures. Having a lower boiling point than the monomer, the ICA maintain the reactant close to the catalysts in the condensed phase. The amount of ICA must be kept below the “stickiness limit” beyond which the bed material becomes too sticky to discharge or to maintain a normal fluidization status. By modulating the amount of ICA into the reactor is possible to control the amount of the condensed phase and, consequently, the quality of the produced polymer (molecular weight, density, etc.). The patent provides a formula for the optimum vapor pressure for two or more condensing agents for increased production rate and increased polymer grade flexibility. The patent reports several data regarding the effect ICA blends on Melt index and density of the polyethylene produced. [3] anticipated these conclusions suggesting to use a hydrocarbon coming from a countercurrent column placed on the gaseous recycle stream. The advantage of this column is to provide an efficient recovery of un reacted monomers solubilized in the liquid hydrocarbon and reinjected in the reactor together with a clean purge of inert components that do not accumulate in the plant. Finally, [4] and [5] propose a under vacuum gas separator instead of the column for the pressure control and hydrocarbon recovery from polymer particles.

## **Silica quenching agent**
A wide range of application to almost all the polyolefin synthesis is the improvement presented by [6]. It describes a new method for quenching polymerization reactions by solid particulate such as amorphous silica. Polymerization processes typically require quenching agents to prevent further polymerization at the end. Unreacted monomers and solvents need to be subsequently recycled back into the reactor. Traditionally, small, polar, protic molecules such as water and methanol are used as quenching agents. However, their use causes both liquid-liquid and liquid vapor separation on the recycling stream. Such processing steps are undesirable as they increase the complexity of the process, often resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Patent proposes amorphous silica (with specific surface area from 30 to 800 m2/g) as new type of quenching agent that does not partition into the recycle in a significant amount along with solvent and unreacted monomer. In fact, any reactive particulate having -OH groups on the surface may be useful as a quenching agent. The choice of silica is most likely done since its compatibility with the further applications of the polyolefin.

## **Antistatic for deposit reduction**
Antistatic agents are used in process for the low-pressure polymerization of olefins to avoid electrostatic charging of the forming polymer particles. It is believed that the antistatic agents reduce wall sheeting and formation of polymer agglomerates in the polymerization reactor and downstream equipment. This is especially true in fluidized bed reactors and cycle reactors. Antistatic agents are made from or contain polar functional groups such as acid, ester, amine and hydroxyl groups. In spite of their low addition (500 -1000 ppm), it is believed that some antistatic agents may negatively impact the activity of olefin polymerization catalysts. They may also preclude the use of polyolefins in food, beverage and medical packaging for the possibility to migrate outside the polymer. [7] proposes an antistatic agent without these negative effects, made by a water solution of low viscosity poly ethers (or polyglycol, poly alcohols). Notably, the water itself acts indistinctly on growing polymer particles independently from their size, while hydroxylated oligomers interact preferentially with the smaller particles that have higher capability to agglomerate and react with the surface. The antistatic agent is introduced directly in the reactor or in the recycle loop.

## **Highly reactive poly isobutene**
Highly reactive poly iso-butene (HR-PIB) is a request polyolefin, especially at low molecular weight, produced by cationic polymerization using Friedel-Craft type catalysts. [8] shows a continuous polymerization process made by a cascade of two reactors: a first homogeneous pre-polymerization unit (HPPU) and a second polymerization in series (HERS). Both units share a heat exchanges and a coolant to control temperature. The HPPU unit is small and has a short residence time. It receives and mixes the reactants made by: isobutene (up to 30%), alkane solvent and catalyst (t-butyl chloride and initiator).The HERS unit can be a heat exchanger reactor with a temperature difference between coolant and internal reactants lower than 3 C with a high resident time achieved by looping the fluid in the tubes. The tight temperature control is made using an evaporative coolant, i.e. a coolant that evaporates at least partially in the HERS. As typical of cation polymerizations, the process temperature is low and the coolant must be able to keep the temperature of the HPPU mixer below 0 C and the HERS maximum temperature always below 100 C. The pressure in the HERS is between 6 and 10 bar.
