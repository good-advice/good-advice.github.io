## **Molecular weight control**
There is a surprisingly high interest in producing ethylene-based polymers with multimodal molecular weight distributions, because they may combine the processability of resin with a balance of desirable properties such as strength, barrier properties, etc. [1]. Each of the following patents provide multimodal distributions in different kind of plants, processes conditions and formulations and many of them claim specific advantages. The general idea of making multimodal distributions is changing the reaction conditions in some way. Low density (LDPE), high density (HDPE) and linear low density (LLDPE) are involved in this trend.
[2] deals with high pressure gas polymerization of LDPE (Figure 1). The molecular weight control is achieved providing more than one injection point for the initiator. A standard continuous polymerization process is modified by the addition of an injection pump with multiple entries along the tube reactor. But also, the reaction temperature is a key point for the molecular weight control. As the temperature rises, the chain transfer to polymer increases versus propagation and the polydispersity index increases. Unfortunately, polydispersity directly correlates with the haze of the polymer. Accordingly, when it is desired to manufacture a low haze grade polymer, it will be necessary to operate at low peak temperatures. Several injection points of the initiator, controlled by a temperature controller of the internal reaction zone, allows to modulate the temperature, so the polydispersity and the haze of the final product. Haze is an important parameter to define the optical properties of the polymer, fundamental for packaging applications. The lower the haze value the higher is the clarity of the polymer. Above 30%, the material is diffusing so it is considered opaque. [3] extends the concept and the method by combining the initiator to chain transfer agent when necessary. Specifically, he describes a high pressure (100-350 MPa) continuous production in a plug flow reactor. A peroxide cocktail of up to five peroxide initiators active in a temperature range between 120 to 335 C is used after dissolution in an organic inert solvent. Reactant feed (order: 160 t/h) is made by ethylene and eventually a comonomer (up to 10%) together with a fix amount of transfer agent (0.8% ca). The initiator solution is injected into the reactor not only at the beginning, as in the standard set up, but also in up to four points along the whole length of the tube reactor (diameter 65 mm ca, length 3000-4500 m). This causes different polymerization zones were different molecular weight polymers are formed. The peak temperature for each reaction zone will advantageously be in the range of 200 to 350 C. 
[4] deals with polymerization of ethylene, propylene and copolymers in gas phase at low pressure and with hydrogen as molecular weight regulator. The scope is always to achieve a polymer with a broad or even multimodal molecular weight distribution with advantages in blow-molding and extrusion applications. The inert gas is Nitrogen or propane and carbon monoxide or water are the inhibitors. Catalysts are Phillips chromium oxide or Ziegler-Natta types. The process is characterized by the presence of three or more polymerization zones which differ in the ratio of hydrogen to the sum of olefins in the gas mixture (Figure 2). The ratio determines the molecular weight of the produced polyolefin: a larger ratio gives lower molecular weight and vice-versa. The amount of hydrogen varies among the zones up to 2 times or more, but it remains constant in a single zone. The growing polymer particles are made in a fluidized bed up to a minimal dimension. Then, they flow upward through a first polymerization zone (riser) under fast fluidization conditions. Later, they enter a second polymerization zone (downcomer) through which they flow downward in a densified form. When particles leave the downcomer, they are reintroduced into the raiser, thereby establishing a circulation of polymer between the two units. The polymer passes a plurality of times through these two zones gradually changing its properties. In the downcomer the polymer particles are in a densified form (i.e. their bulk density is high compared to the one observed in the riser) and move in a plug-flow mode (i.e. with little or no back-mixing). Gaseous and liquid feed streams are introduced at one or more position to the downcomer to control the gas ratio composition. Streams contain one or more comonomers, inert gas or hydrogen. The riser is only needed to transport the growing polymer particles from the outlet to the inlet of the downcomer. So, it operates under fast fluidization conditions by feeding a reaction gas mixture at a velocity higher than the transport velocity of the polymer particles (0.8-5 m/s). In some cases, a solid/gas separator is arranged above the downcomer to separate the polyolefin and reaction gaseous mixture coming from the riser. In this way the gas composition is made uniform and ready to be modified by the new streams in the downcomer. To improve the difference of reacting conditions between riser and downcomer, a barrier liquid mixture is fed at the top of the downcomer. This liquid may be the bottom phase of the gas mixture previously extracted and processed in a distillation column. The hydrogen rich gaseous fraction, withdrawn from the top of the distillation column, is fed in the ending part of the downcomer providing a significant boost of the hydrogen/olefin ratio. [5] suggests the possibility to regulate the hydrogen concentration in a recycle stream, where a catalytic reaction hydrogenates the unreacted monomer (e.g. propylene) to a correspondent alkane (e.g. propane). [6] instead claims the importance of controlling the bottom temperature of the riser. In this zone, they operate with temperature close to the condensation point of the reacting gas, in order to obtain a controlled amount of condensate. In this manner, the polymerization in the riser is not negatively affected and higher production rates are achieved in the downcomer.
The molecular weight control is also studied in solution polymerization using a standard loop reactor. [7] and [8] revise the ability to regulate reactor temperature and improve catalyst efficiency. In loop reactors, the reactor feed is introduced into the recirculation stream at a suitable point in the loop and the product is withdrawn at a different point from the recycle. The ratio by mass of the recirculating flow to fresh feed flow can be varied from 0 (to mimic the performance of a plug flow reactor) to 15 and above (to mimic the performance of stirred tank reactor). Authors suggest to feed Ziegler-Natta catalyst and activator solution by separate injection in at least two different streams. A more finely tuned control is achievable when feeds are more than two. Moreover, different feeds allow increased injection rates. The greater velocity (from 2.5 up to 20 ft/s) prevents the catalyst and the activator particles from settling in the feed lines and the increased number of injection points provides beneficial mixing. 
[9] works on the composition of the catalyst instead than the number of feeders. The polymer structure is influenced by the catalyst: Ziegler-Natta catalyst and chromium-based catalysts often produce compositions with broad distributions, whereas metallocene catalysts typically produce compositions with narrow distributions. The same idea of working on the catalyst composition is adopted by [10] for the synthesis of HDPE in gas phase. However, he avoids multimodal molecular weight distribution, preferring a monomodal but extremely large distribution. This solution is optimal to obtain: high impact and transparency (provided by the low molecular weight fraction) together with hardness, heat and chemical resistance (given by the high molecular weight fraction). A single but broad molecular weight distribution (correlated with a high Melt Flow Index) is required for a good flowability in injection molding and extrusion. Since titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst or chromium-based catalysts provide narrow distributions, the author provides combinations of catalysts to match the requirements. 
[11] produces a bimodal polyethylene distributed material, but it uses a quite simple methodology. He suggests to blend a fraction of polyethylene at low molecular weight (Mw=20000, Mn=9000 g/mol) together with an equal or lower massive fraction of high molecular weight (Mw=300000, Mn= 16000 g/mol). Two fractions may be produced by polymerizing ethylene in two cascade polymerization reactors that operate at different conditions. Alternatively, the two fractions may be produced in the same reactor by using two polymerization catalysts where the catalysts have different selectivity. The patent also releases the best application of this material in pipes to transport liquids and gas. Typically, pipes must be able to withstand pressure, because liquids or gas usually are pressurized. It is desirable to have pipes of good coilability facilitating easy installation and avoid fractures, if pipe is too stiff, fractures may occur. Therefore, the density of the material needs to be sufficiently low, but generally a low density corresponds to a poor pressure resistance. A good processability of the polyethylene composition is desirable and this is typical of low molecular weight materials. However high molecular weight is needed for meeting the requirements of good pressure resistance at elevated temperatures and low creep, even though processing of such high Mw resins alone is more difficult. A polymer with bimodal distribution is the easiest solution.
[12] suggests that the blending of the two fractions of polyethylene should be done on melt state and gradually to preserve the molecular size. [13] provides multimodal polyolefins distribution extending the number of blending components to three, among which one is an ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) polymer. Typically, a UHMW has a molecular weight above 3 million and a density less than 935 kg/m3, and its blending with lower size materials improves dramatically the mechanical properties. There are serious compatibility problems to incorporate high molecular weight to low molecular weight and the Patent seems to solve this problem adding an intermediate molecular weight component.
Although the blending of polymer with different molecular weights to broad the distribution seems to be an easy and efficient way, mechanical methods are limited by the physical mixing of the original polymers. So, the mixture results different from a polymer having a similarly broad or multimodal molecular weight distribution produced in a single process. [14] suggests a further easy way to meet the target. Broad molecular weight distribution can be produced in a single reactor using at least two independently controlled catalysts feeders each supplying different proportions of at least two active catalysts. By controlling the catalyst feed rate, polymers having targeted molecular weight distribution can be readily produced. The composition of the catalyst system is detailed in the following section.

## **Composition control**
Many polyolefins are copolymers of ethylene with other monomers (e.g. hexene). With copolymers, not only the molecular weight distribution affects properties but also the composition. The different composition influences: extractable content, environmental stress crack resistance, heat sealing, impact, tear and strength resistance. Much effort has been placed in understanding how the comonomer is distributed along the polymer carbon chain. The composition distribution of an ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer refers to the distribution of comonomer as a distribution of short chain branches. When the distribution of short chain branches varies among the backbone, the polymer is said to have a Broad Composition Distribution (BCD) and if the amount of comonomer is similar among the molecules of different molecular weights, the composition distribution is said to be narrow (NCD). Recently a third distribution has been documented as Broad Orthogonal Composition Distribution (BOCD) in which the comonomer is incorporated predominantly in the high molecular weight chains. Catalysts influence the polymer composition. Polymers made with Ziegler-Natta catalysts give broad distribution, but the high molecular weight fractions are higher density (i.e. less comonomer) than the lower molecular weight (high comonomer). In contrast, metallocene catalysts typically produce polyolefin with an NCD. [15] and the following patents focus on the production of polymer with BOCD distribution. BOCD behavior has been associated with a good balance of mechanical and optical properties. For example, LLDPE films strive for a good balance of stiffness, toughness, optical properties (haze and gloss) and processability. Sealing performance, key property in films, is affected mainly by density, it improves as density gets lower, but density has the opposite effect of stiffness. There is an interdependence between molecular weight and comonomer distribution on sealing performance and BOCD is the optimal solution. [16] proposes a solution based on a combination of two specific metallocene catalysts and the method of their use. [17] includes the possibility to use an activator (alumoxane compound) to convert the neutral metal compound to a catalytically active metal cation. [18] defines the comonomer types: C3-C10 alpha-olefins and the temperature range: 10 to 75 C.
Composition control can be achieved by a physical blend of different polymers as suggested by [19] and [20]. Blending LLDPE with LDPE increases bubble stability in part due to the high melt strength (MS) of the LDPE and the increase of MS helps provide for an increase of film output. There is a need to control the composition monitored by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and find an optimized balance. Patents report equations useful to find a correct correlation between MS and blow film properties. [21] blends ethylene α-olefin elastomer (65-90 wt %) having no crystallinity with isotactic polypropylene (10-35 wt%) to reach the optimal MS for film and other application.
Composition control is key when polyolefins are used for special applications such as the coating of low voltage electrical cable, object of [22] work. Low Voltage Power cable operates at voltage below 6 kV. The conductor, typically copper, is coated with an insulation polyolefin layer by extrusion. Cables must resist to prolonged expose to wind and weather and the Oxygen Induction Time (OIT) is a good indicator of the resistance. OIT is a standardized measured of the time between melting and the onset decomposition in isothermal conditions (190-220 C) achieved by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The patent proposes a copolymer of ethylene and monomer with silane groups (VTES – vinyl trimethoxy silane, VTMS- vinyl trimethoxy silane) in the range of 0.5 to 3 wt %. Moreover, the copolymer must have a high molecular weight (express as MFR2 < 10 g/10 min) and limit the number of short oligomers unable to crosslink in the extrusion. The copolymer is made in a standard process of high-pressure polymerization in a tube reactor with multiple injection feeds. The high pressure (up to 4000 bar) is achieved by piston compressors that require the use of a lubricant. As known, lubricants (typically PAG- poly alkylene glycols) leak through the seals, mix with the monomers and participate to the reaction as CTA. The Patent observes the influence of lubricant on the hot set elongation of the polymer, i.e. the permanent elongation after storage a 200 C. Since an increase of elongation is detrimental for cable application, the inventor uses paraffinic hydrocarbons with MW lower than 480 as compressor lubricant, since their effect on the polymer is minimum.
Composition control is also a solution for LDPE onto paperboard extrusion laminations, where the advantage would be improved adhesion in the multi-layer structures, such as aseptic drink boxes, snack packaging, cheese packaging, etc. A good “fiber tear” adhesion is achieved when an adhesion between the polymer to the paper greater than the adhesion of the paper fiber to themselves. [23] claims that the optimal copolymer is made by ethylene with carbon monoxide (CO) having a content greater than 0 to less than 10 wt % CO on the whole polymer. Moreover, a low melt flow index (between 3 -30 g/10 minutes) guarantees the fastest speed in extrusion. Such kind of copolymers are made by a high-pressure polymerization of ethylene in a plug flow reactor with several injection points of CO along all the tube length.

## **Optimal amount and type of condensing agents**
There is a need and desire to increase production rates while maintaining the continuity of the microstructure properties (molecular weight, branching, composition, etc.) in a continuous process of gas polyolefin production. [24] and  [25] face this problem in a fluidized bed process and focalizes on the use of condensing agents. The condensing mode of operation in a fluidized bed reactor significantly increases the production rate by providing extra heat removal capacity through the evaporation of condensates in the cycle gas. Additional condensation is achieved by adding an inert condensing agent (ICA) into the reactor. ICA is a hydrocarbon with such as propane, isobutane or isopentane and their mixtures. Having a lower boiling point than the monomer, the ICA maintain the reactant close to the catalysts in the condensed phase. The amount of ICA must be kept below the “stickiness limit” beyond which the bed material becomes too sticky to discharge or to maintain a normal fluidization status. By modulating the amount of ICA into the reactor is possible to control the amount of the condensed phase and, consequently, the quality of the produced polymer (molecular weight, density, etc.). The patent provides a formula for the optimum vapor pressure for two or more condensing agents for increased production rate and increased polymer grade flexibility. The patent reports several data regarding the effect ICA blends on Melt index and density of the polyethylene produced. [26] anticipated these conclusions suggesting to use a hydrocarbon coming from a countercurrent column placed on the gaseous recycle stream. The advantage of this column is to provide an efficient recovery of un reacted monomers solubilized in the liquid hydrocarbon and reinjected in the reactor together with a clean purge of inert components that do not accumulate in the plant. Finally, [27] and [28] propose a under vacuum gas separator instead of the column for the pressure control and hydrocarbon recovery from polymer particles.

## **Silica quenching agent**
A wide range of application to almost all the polyolefin synthesis is the improvement presented by [29]. It describes a new method for quenching polymerization reactions by solid particulate such as amorphous silica. Polymerization processes typically require quenching agents to prevent further polymerization at the end. Unreacted monomers and solvents need to be subsequently recycled back into the reactor. Traditionally, small, polar, protic molecules such as water and methanol are used as quenching agents. However, their use causes both liquid-liquid and liquid vapor separation on the recycling stream. Such processing steps are undesirable as they increase the complexity of the process, often resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Patent proposes amorphous silica (with specific surface area from 30 to 800 m2/g) as new type of quenching agent that does not partition into the recycle in a significant amount along with solvent and unreacted monomer. In fact, any reactive particulate having -OH groups on the surface may be useful as a quenching agent. The choice of silica is most likely done since its compatibility with the further applications of the polyolefin.

## **Antistatic for deposit reduction**
Antistatic agents are used in process for the low-pressure polymerization of olefins to avoid electrostatic charging of the forming polymer particles. It is believed that the antistatic agents reduce wall sheeting and formation of polymer agglomerates in the polymerization reactor and downstream equipment. This is especially true in fluidized bed reactors and cycle reactors. Antistatic agents are made from or contain polar functional groups such as acid, ester, amine and hydroxyl groups. In spite of their low addition (500 -1000 ppm), it is believed that some antistatic agents may negatively impact the activity of olefin polymerization catalysts. They may also preclude the use of polyolefins in food, beverage and medical packaging for the possibility to migrate outside the polymer. [30] proposes an antistatic agent without these negative effects, made by a water solution of low viscosity poly ethers (or polyglycol, poly alcohols). Notably, the water itself acts indistinctly on growing polymer particles independently from their size, while hydroxylated oligomers interact preferentially with the smaller particles that have higher capability to agglomerate and react with the surface. The antistatic agent is introduced directly in the reactor or in the recycle loop.

## **Highly reactive poly isobutene**
Highly reactive poly iso-butene (HR-PIB) is a request polyolefin, especially at low molecular weight, produced by cationic polymerization using Friedel-Craft type catalysts. [31] shows a continuous polymerization process made by a cascade of two reactors: a first homogeneous pre-polymerization unit (HPPU) and a second polymerization in series (HERS). Both units share a heat exchanges and a coolant to control temperature. The HPPU unit is small and has a short residence time. It receives and mixes the reactants made by: isobutene (up to 30%), alkane solvent and catalyst (t-butyl chloride and initiator).The HERS unit can be a heat exchanger reactor with a temperature difference between coolant and internal reactants lower than 3 C with a high resident time achieved by looping the fluid in the tubes. The tight temperature control is made using an evaporative coolant, i.e. a coolant that evaporates at least partially in the HERS. As typical of cation polymerizations, the process temperature is low and the coolant must be able to keep the temperature of the HPPU mixer below 0 C and the HERS maximum temperature always below 100 C. The pressure in the HERS is between 6 and 10 bar.
