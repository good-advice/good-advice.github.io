## **Reactor for PET recycling**
The manufacture of bottles, tires or any kind of gum-like polymers is now promoting the recycling of articles, which are increasingly consumed by people, to reduce the volume of solid waste. An interesting method of Poly ethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling, called “chemical recycling”, is based on the concept of depolymerizing the condensation polymer through solvolytic chain cleavage into low molecular -weight products which can be purified and reused as raw materials for the production of high-quality chemical products. The chemical pathway is detailed by [1]. [2] provides a device, system and procedure for recycling with a high level of efficiency and simple and low-cost construction. The reactor is formed by a vertical structure composed of two ferrous concentric tanks that form an air jacket between them. The recycling material, broken in small granules, enters by a rocket valve from the top. In the lid of the reactor a chimney is also arranged for the discharge of flow of air from inside the reactor. Inside the inner tank, a stirring unit composed of a vertical axis with a plurality of blades of different positions and sizes, stir the reacting material. A hot air inlet at the bottom enters in the external jacket and from it to the inside tank gradually, allowing the suspension of the material, emulating a fluidized bed reactor. The reactor design allows different zones where different level of pressures and temperatures. In this way, in the upper part of the reactor temperatures in the range of 200-250 C are obtained, while in the intermediate part the temperatures range between 300 and 400C. This difference of temperatures is also achieved thanks to other factors such as the great pressure inside the reactor, the exothermic reactions produced by the material processing and to the presence of the thermal jacket wrapping up the reactor with different grade of insulation.

## **Mixer-free reactor for solution polyolefin polymerization**
Catalyst based solution polymerization of polyolefins requires a good temperature control achievable with a good mixing. The mixer-equipped reactor has a disadvantage of requiring an additional expensive motor for driving the mixer. Therefore, mixer-equipped reactor is disadvantages in terms of high facility investment cost, operation and maintenance cost attributable to the expensive motor. [3] projects a new reactor structure capable of preparing polymers having homogeneous physical properties by improving flowability of a reaction without using a stirrer. The scope is reached controlling and direct the flow inside a cylindrical vessel. A feed inlet installed at the lower portion of the reactor vessel allows the feed monomer, solvent and catalyst into the reactor. A guide pipe having a cylindrical shape being open at the respective ends is installed along the central axis of the vessel and divides an internal space into an up-flow region where the reaction mixture flows downwards. A swirling flow-inducing blade attached to the exterior surface of the guide pipe, causes the reaction mixture to rise along the exterior surface of the guide pipe while forming a swirling flow. Patent shows qualitative reactor drawings.

## **Reactor for expandable microspheres**
In cosmetic, hollow, air filled microspheres are used to provide volume and texture to hair without weighting it down over time. A microsphere consists of a thermoplastic polymer shell initially filled with a fluid (liquid or gas) such that, when heated, the shell softens and the fluid inside expands, resulting in a sphere the expands like a balloon up to as much as four times its initial size. After the heat source is removed, the shell stays in its deformed state. One common method for expanding polymeric microspheres is by slurring the spheres in a solvent, typically water, and heating in and extruder or spray dryer. [4] provides a new solvent-free process that relays on a new type of reactor. The reactor is a jacketed vessel fitted with a single motion agitator comprising an anchor-type frame and shaft, with horizontal, pitched blades welded to the frame and shaft, and scraper blades affixed to the frame, sufficient to provide adequate turnover of the microspheres along the sidewalls of the tank, such that the resultant product is a free-flowing powder of specific, larger particle size. Patent shows drawings of reactor and stirrer from 40 to 200 gallons volume. The particles size is between 10 to 120 micron and the chemical composition could be any thermoplastic polymer.

## **Aqueous polymer solutions device**
[5] and [6] release an apparatus for the production of an aqueous polymer solution from polymer dry powders. Hydrated polymers are widely used in industry as thickeners and rheology modifiers. In solution they are in the form which is typically referred to as a gel. They may be synthetic (i.e. carbomers, polyacrylamides) or natural (i.e. CMC, guar, xanthan gums) and they are supplied in the form of dry powders. Such polymers are normally made up into aqueous solution at the site where they are intended to be used. If the powder is added to water incorrectly the hydrating particles can stick to the equipment and to each other, resulting in lumps or agglomerates in solution. Unfortunately, lumps or agglomerates tend not to dissolve once they are formed. Most commercially available powder make-up systems employ a screw feed to meet the powder into the water. The feeder consists of an Archimedes Screw type augur or scroll connected to a drive motor. Quite often the screw is blocked by the particulate materials, made sticky by the adsorption of water vapor.
The apparatus and the procedure suggested by the patents provide a uniform and lump free polymer solution in a continuous way. Core of the invention is a device for cutting the hydrate polymer particles into small pieces. Polymer particles drop in a tubular container. At the bottom of the container, a centrally mounted nozzle forms a water ascending stream that impacts the incoming particles. A high-pressure stream of water is ejected perpendicular to the axis of the container and rotates and forms a circular disc pattern around the central nozzle. A sieve tray is located in the bottom, beneath the nozzle and prevents oversized polymer lumps from passing. Several possible variations of the spraying elements are presented depending of the polymer and plant requirements.

## **Separation vessel for polyolefins**
In high pressure polyethylene production (Figure 1), after the tube reactor only 40% of the ethylene monomers react and a separation is required to recirculate the gas phase. This is done in two steps at decreasing pressure. Specifically, the second step at 300 bars is required to recover the last 10% residual gaseous ethylene and recover the solid polymer for admitting it into an extruder. The outers walls of the low-pressure separator vessel are continuously heated by means of steam jacket in order to maintain the polymeric material flowable. Unfortunately, the inner surface of the vessel, due to its closeness to the steam jacket, is covered by cross-linked degraded polymers. If the degraded polymers are not periodically removed, they can contaminate the final polyethylene and degrade its appearance. Cross-linked residue has a high molecular weight and increase the polydispersity of the melt polymer, and this increases the haze and reduces the transparency of the blown film products. To solve this problem, inventors suggest a removable cover of the vessel together with an internal 0.05 to 0.15 mm layer of polytetrafluoroethylene lining. The cleaning procedure suggests a cooling water in the jacket in the ending part of vessel unload. In this way a thin polyethylene film is formed on the internal surface but it has a very poor adhesion to the wall. The film is easily removed when the vessel cover is open. The cleaning process takes only two hours compared with the one-day routine maintenance.

## **Spiral heat exchange for devolatilization of polyolefins**
Also, in solution polyolefin production monomers and solvents need to be recycled back into the polymerization process. Usually, removal of monomers and solvents is achieved through devolatilization of the polymer solution stream. Devolatilization is achieved by raising the temperature of the polymer solution above the boiling point of the polymer solution and removing the volatile components. Typically, shell and tube heat exchangers (STHE) and plate heat exchangers (PHE) have been used as the preheater during devolatilization. None of them is fully satisfactory due to the high viscosity of the stream. [7] introduces a new heat exchanger with increased heat transfer, smaller footprints, lower temperature gradients and lower pressure drops. The polymer solution stream enters to a spiral heat exchange from the top and produces a second effluent stream. When the first effluent stream flows through the spiral heat exchanger in a cross-flow direction relative to spirals performs a separation of the second effluent reverted back the exchanger. The separation provides a polymer free of solvent and a gaseous stream made by solvent and unreacted monomer. Patent provides drawing and schema of the unit.
[8] suggests to passivate the catalyst before devolatilization. The new unit is added in the recycle loop where the polymerized solids are contacted with catalyst poison compounds (selected from carbon monoxide or dioxide, oxygen, water alcohols or amines), thereby forming a passivated stream. A further gas stripping reduces the VOC content of at least 10% of the initial content.

## **Screen classification for polymer particles**
Superabsorbent polymer particles must have a size between 150 and 850 microns for the use in diapers. Unfortunately, standard classification methods over screen of different pore size are not efficient. The most frequent problem is the blockage of the screen surface and the deterioration in the classifying efficiency. A further problem is the caking tendency of the product particles which leads to undesired agglomerates before, after and during the screening. A higher screening quality is typically achieved by adding surfactants to the product which serve to increases the free flow and reduce the stickiness of the particles. [9] eliminates the use of surfactants by inventing a new screening process. A screening machine with 4 screens of different size operates under moderate vacuum conditions. A key condition is: the pressure above the uppermost sieve is 4.0 mbar per sieve higher than the pressure below the undermost sieve. The pressure profile inside the machine is the control parameter. High pressure drops over the sieves reduces the separation efficiency because particles that could not pass increase their agglomeration with the pressure drop. These findings combine with [10], where the oversize fraction of polymer particles is recycled after deagglomeration with a roll crusher.

## **Multi-cascade reactor flow sheet for polyolefins**
During certain intervals stirred tank reactors of reactor cascade used for slurry polymerization require maintenance work, for example because of failure or reactor equipment such reactor slurry pumps. The process has to be stopped and one or all reactors need to be emptied. Only the last polymerization rector can be isolated and its material recovered since fits commercial product specification. Polymers in other reactors must be disposed and treated as waste. Therefore, plant flow sheets should be revised to minimize the amount of off-spec materials. [11] proposes a plant with two or more reactors equipped with and external loop able to recirculate on themselves but, if required, to transfer the whole content in one of each of the other reactors. On this set up, all the reacting streams can be easily processed up to the final conversion in the reactors do not involved in maintenance.
[12] proposes the same three reactor cascade with another purpose: reduce the consumption of catalyst. Catalyst and co-catalyst are injected only in the first reactor, the co-catalyst is added in the second and nothing in the third. The consumption of catalyst is minimized without modifying the quantity and quality of the product.

## **Methods to avoid water contamination in polyolefin production**
Water is generally a poison to polymerization catalysts and therefore its presence in the reactor system is undesirable. Startup is enabled by charging a seed bed of polymer to the empty reactor prior the introduction of the reactants. This seed bed is likely to have been exposed to the atmosphere and contains adsorbed water. Moisture trapped in polymer granules can generate electrostatic charges and modify the reaction course. Utilizing nitrogen purge to remove water from the reactor system prior startup can take days, with additional delays encountered as any residual water reacts with the first catalyst that is introduced. [13] proposes the use of a desiccant and a sacrificial amount catalyst in the polymer seed bed at startup. The desiccant can comprise a molecular sieve (dehydrated silica or alumina) because water does not have to chemically react with a scavenger and a simple physical sequestration can be sufficient to preserve the catalyst.
[14] suggests a different solution that does not modify the composition of the bed. After the reactor is filled with the seed bed, an alkyl solution is injected; the bed is then soaked for at least one hour; the concentration of ethane in the reactor is continuously monitored; the purge ends and the monomer can be fed when the ethane concentration reaches an equilibrium. The equilibrium of ethane concentration indicates that moisture has been removed and stripped out from the polymer bed. The alkyl solution comprises triethylammonium (TEAL) able to react with water and free ethane as byproduct.

## **Fluid bed reactor with improved cooling capability**
One of the biggest challenges of exothermic polymerization reactions in gas solid olefin polymerization reactors is the cooling of the reactor. The fluidization gas moving upwards through the dense phase where the polymerization takes place removes the most part of the heat. In order to prevent excessive powder entrainment into the fluidization gas stream, the superficial gas velocity has to be limited which results in inefficient mixing of the polyolefin and low heat exchange. Since the flow rate is limited two possible options are left: the entry temperature of the gas stream and the efficiency of the contact between gas and solid phase. [15] and [16] basically redraw the fluid dynamic inside the reactor to maximize the heat exchange. An external loop moves back to bottom the gas stream and its temperature is efficiently reduced by external heat exchanges. The re-injection of the gas is split in several points from the bottom to the top in order to maintain a uniform movement of the powder inside the reactor. Patents detail the physical conditions of each entries.
