Electronic uses high-quality, high-purity polymers in almost all devices and production steps. Many applications require the assembly of polymers in thin films with different layers having different features (domain spacing and morphology). These are combined with either “bottom-up” (substrate modification) or “top-down” (lithography) techniques for locally controlling the morphology.
In the production of Integrated Circuits (IC), circuits are printed on a silicon wafer partially covered with a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). The production starts etching holes by a reactive ion beam (DRIE) in a front side of the CMOS layer. Then, holes are filled with a sacrificial material (photoresist) to provide a planar frontside surface for further steps. [1] suggests to make a preliminary layer of a thermoplastic polyimide and warm it above its glass transition temperature (ca 90 C) before making the photo imageable polyimides layer. Thermoplastic polymer, which has a lower viscosity than the photo resists material, can be reflowed when heated and fills the holes in a uniform way. With the same purpose, [2] makes a uniform film of polyimide by UV curing from a low viscosity polyimide precursor (tetra caboxylic acid diester). As alternative, the [3] introduces a new polymer made by repeated aromatic unit (benzene or naphthalene rings) connected by Nitrogen as planarizing agent. Finally, [4] simplifies the whole procedure with a single photosensitive polymer instead of the double layer of polyimides. The polymer has a silicone structure containing groups able to better cover the holes and smooth the surface before hardening under the effect of light.
The wide spreading flash memory market and the demand for increased storage capacities drive forward process improvement. Two or more circuit patterns by photoresist lithography are produced in the same line thanks to a continuous improvement of miniaturization technology going towards 10 nm. Extreme ultraviolet light of wavelength 13.5 nm is capable of forming pattern with a size of the order of 10 nm via single exposure, but suffers from the problems of still low laser power and low productivity. The request of new polymeric materials required for the circuit design by negative lithography is very high since existing materials are insufficient for this purpose. Negative lithography requires etching a substrate by using a resist pattern as a mask. The resist pattern is obtained on the substrate by irradiating a thin-film with light to induce crosslinking thereby remarkably changing the solubility of the thin film. The following development treatment with a solvent remove the excess of the unreacted monomer. [5], [6] and [7] propose new monomers (and related polymers) forming a negative pattern in alkaline developer and having the required etch resistance. Authors insert in the monomer a substituent group (fluorine based) capable of polarity switch under the action of acid. The polymer comprising the monomer has a high affinity and dissolution rate in the alkaline developer liquid. But the polymer eliminates the fluorinated group with the acid generated by an acid-generator activated by the exposure to light. After elimination of the fluorinated group, the polymer forms a negative pattern not more soluble in alkali.
The lithography using electron beam has a specific problem of electrification phenomenon (charge-up) during exposure. This happens when the substrate, irradiated with electron beam, is coated with an insulating resist film as happens in the negative lithography. The substrate accumulates electric charge and bent the new coming electron beam and the precision of the drawing is significantly reduced. The solution could be a photoresist material made by a conductive polymer with low resistivity and high ability to release the charge improving the antistatic property of the film. [8] proposes a polyaniline composites using a polyaniline that has a high electric conductivity but poor dispersibility in water, together with a dopant polymer reach of sulfo-groups to improves water affinity.
[9] deals with multi-layered thin film encapsulation of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) in order to protect the device from moisture and oxygen. The multilayer thin films are composed of stacks of alternating layers of the polymeric films and inorganic barrier layers (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 etc.). The inorganic layer is made by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), instead the polymeric layer is now deposed by inject printing. The curable ink typically includes one or more primary film forming monomers, one or more multifunctional cross-linking agents and one or more photo-initiators. The light source used to activate the photo-initiator is narrow spectrum (365-420 nm) UV light coming from a low power (200 mW/cm2) emitting diode (LED). The low power and the fast vitrification of the surface, leave unreacted a lot of photo-initiator. It migrates in the polymeric film as volatile species and reacts with functional layers deteriorating the whole performance of the device. The Patent suggests a second exposure of at least 50 s to a plasma irradiation. The high energy ions and radicals easily react with residual photo-initiator prior its migration. The process results convenient because it does not require further apparatus and the second plasma irradiation can be easily combined with PECVD.
[10] finds a totally different solution to multiple layer deposition. Standard techniques lead to an orientation switch, an order-disorder transition and a limited size variation of the thickness. The new method exposes a polymer film comprising a first polymer to a vapor comprising a polymerizable monomer, wherein the polymerizable monomer diffuse into, and swells, the polymer film. Then, the polymerizable monomers are reacted into a second polymer on the first polymeric layer. This method enables the hierarchical manipulation of nanopatterns in polymer thin film by changing their underlying composition. Changes in the thin film that can be controlled by the methods include changes in the morphology (shape), size and spacing in the domains within the polymer film. The initiator, when used, can be embedded in a polymer film by dissolving the first polymer and the initiator in a solvent, applying the solution as a coating on the substrate surface, and allowing the volatile components of the solution to evaporate. After the second monomer deposition the initiator is activated via exposure to an external stimulus, such as radiation, heat, and electron beam. The new layer is a self-assembled block copolymer organized in a plurality of lamellae or cylinders, horizontally or vertically oriented with respect the substrate surface. The thickness of the new layer goes from 10 to 500 nm. Example of material used are: polystyrene-b-polyisoprene-b-polystyrene (SIS) as first layer, diphenyl (2,4,6 - tri-methylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO) as photo-initiator and isoprene as second monomer.
Photovoltaic devices are devices able to convert the energy of light radiation into electric energy. Currently most of photovoltaic devices uses pure crystalline silicon with high production cost. Alternative organic materials having conjugated, oligomeric or polymeric structure, are under scrutiny for the production of solar cells. They are light and cheap and as organic material can be recycled at the end of its use. [11] found that anthraditiophene derivatives can be used in the synthesis of electro donor polymers. Electrodonors adsorb a photon from the light and dissociate it in two charges: a negative one transferred to an acceptor substance (typically a fullerene derivative) and a positive one maintained in the donor. Donor and acceptor transfer the charges to connected anode and cathode starting the electrical flow. Many polymers are already identified as donors and the Patent list them, however, they are not optimal because only a small part of solar radiation is converted to energy. Anthraditiophene derivatives can be functionalized to achieve electron rich and electron-poor monomers. Alternating monomers in the same backbone brings to an efficient polymer donor. The polymerization is done by a sequence Stille coupling reactions.
Many of the previous processes use polyimide as insulating material for semiconductor wafers because its outstanding physical properties. Unfortunately, polyimide typically requires a long time to cure when conventional heating techniques are used. A cure cycle of several hours is typical and often becomes the rate determining step in semiconductor fabrication. In addition, when polyimide is cured in a conventional surface the outer surface of the resin cures faster than the center portions. This causes various physical defects, such as the formation of voids, reduced modulus, enhanced swelling, increased solvent uptake and high coefficient of thermal expansion. A polyimide precursor may be applied to the substrate, as said by [93] and then dried to prepare for imidization of the polymer. A goal of the drying process is to remove the solvent (NMP- N methyl-2-pyrrolidone) and it can be also be important to remove oxygen without forming any bubbles in the layer. [12] provides a process and [13] a specific tool (vapor trap) for polyimide drying. The process uses a sequential set of descending pressure operations that allow for time efficient processing of wafers. The set of descending pressure operations are interspersed with evacuation steps using heated gases, which combine heating and solvent evacuation. The process results in layers with reduced or eliminated voiding, discoloration and solvent retention.
Liquid crystal display elements (LCD) have excellent visible light permeability and properties such as heat, chemical, crack resistance. Silicone polymers have been gaining attention because they have many of required properties. A silicone polymer can be synthesized by conducting a hydrolysis-condensation reaction of hydrolysable silicone compound in the presence of a base (or acid) and then removing a solvent for concentration [14]. [15] teaches how to make a silicone polymer with a reduced number of silanol end groups. When many of such silanol groups remain in the polymer, they keep reacting on the storage after production and the viscosity increases. The reaction is a hydrolysis/condensation in a water /alcohol solution using a base (e.g. tetramethylammonium hydroxide) as catalyst. The reactant is a commonly used silane (methacryl oxypropyl trimethoxy silane, methyltrimethoxy silane) and it is added dropwise keeping the temperature around 40 C. After the polymer formation, the polymeric growth is stopped by the addition of a short chain organic acid (e.g. citric, acetic acid).
