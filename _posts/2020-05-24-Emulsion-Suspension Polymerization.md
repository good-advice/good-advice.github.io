## **Core-shell re-dispersible powder for construction and optics**
Re-dispersible polymer powders are widely used in cement-based waterproofing systems, floor screeds, tile adhesives, etc. and provide flexibility and a controlled rheological profile. They are made compatible to the matrix by spray drying on the polymer latex some anti-caking additives (colloids and silica). These additives prevent the irreversible aggregation during storage and promote the redispersion in the final application. [1] proposes a brilliant solution with a core-shell particle having a polymer core and a continuous silica shell. The key steps of the process are:
- Providing an aqueous polymer dispersion comprising polymer particle made by standard emulsion polymerization. The patent covers almost all the existing polymers in civil applications but the choice is not limited since commercial latexes can be used.
- Adjusting the pH in the range 7 to 10 by mineral acids after the addition of a mediator agent, if required. The mediator agent is a non-ionic or cationic surfactant the make the surface of the particle more neutral.
- Adding sodium or potassium silicate (water glass) to the aqueous polymer dispersion in the range of 5 to 40%, based on total weight of polymers.
- Drying (by fluid bed or spray tower or drum dryers) and achieving a powder.
The silicate makes an external layer (1.5 to 10 nm thick) over particles with diameter between 100 to 1500 nm. Thus, the powder has a high storage stability, des not lead to any coloration and improves the wet strength of the final product. The polymer core cannot unfold its properties and is protected from outside influences. Only after the shell is at least partially removed, by dissolution or shear stress, the core can develop its properties and is accessible to influences of the surrounding medium. [2] further improves the invention including water soluble salt of multivalent metal and anions (aluminate, borate, carbonate).
Core polymer particles with silicate shell are reference materials in sensor technology, in medical diagnostic and optic as point out in [3]. Light scattering particles with spherical shape, diameter about 0.5 to 10 microns, refractive index of 1.59 for excitation at 589 nm and density between 1.09 to 1.53 g/cm3 are very requested in optical applications. Common silicon dioxide particles are used but their density close to 2 g/cm3 drives a rapid sedimentation. The patent uses polystyrene or polyvinylpyrrolidone particles covered with 5 up 50 wt % of a silica layer. Depending of the composition of the core, the surface can be modulated from smooth to multi pores and the area growths of up 3 times. The silicate shell is formed directly on the core particle mainly by electrostatic and acid base interactions using a sol-gel first and a functionalization with an organic chlorosilane or alkoxysilane derivate.

## **Phase Change Materials (PCM) via emulsion polymerization**
“Pickering emulsions” are special type of emulsifier-free latexes. Colloidal solid particles (nanoparticles of silica, zin oxide, etc.) are positioned in the interface of the two miscible phases of the emulsion preventing the particles from coalescing due to the fact that total free-energy is reduced (particle-water, particle-oil interactions). Strictly speaking, this polymerization is a dispersion polymerization more than an emulsion polymerization. Beside that [4] associates this method with the interesting concept of PCM. PCMs are materials able to storing and realizing thermal energy during the melting and solidification process. When the material initially in the liquid state cools down, it releases energy in the form of solidification (or crystallization) latent heat. Inversely, when a material initially in solid state melts some energy is absorbed from the environmental. PCMs in the form of thermo-functional nanostructures may generate products in cosmetic, pharmaceutics and medical equipment. The patent proposes a process where:
- Emulsification of the PCM (triglycerides of vegetal oil with melting point of 32 C) with the colloidal oxide nanoparticles in aqueous phase, making a pre-emulsion
- Reducing the drop size of the pre-emulsion by high pressure homogenizer (50 C - 900 bars)
- Adsorption of the monomers (methacrylic acid and hydroxy ethyl methacrylate)
- Polymerization by sodium persulfate radical initiator at 70 C
- Drying the product in solid form by fluidized bed drying or spray driers
The thermal effect is given by the ability of the nanostructure to reflects and diffuses UV radiation. A different method, described in [5], produces similar materials via interfacial polymerization of cyano-acrylate type monomers.

## **Composition control in suspension polymerization**
Ion-exchange resins are produced in a form of polymeric beads by suspension polymerization. Typical monomers are styrene (S) and divinylbenzene (DVB) cross-linked copolymers. After polymerization a standard sulfonation process, using sulfuric acid, introduces (up mol 95 %) sulfonic acid groups making the final strong acid cation (SAC) exchange resin. SACs are valued mainly by measuring the amount of water adsorbed by the polymeric beads via the MHC (moisture hold capacity) method. The goal of [6] is to increase the MHC value and reduce the amount of DVB, because multifunctional vinyl monomers are more expensive than others. It is well known that due to the different reactivity in the suspension monomer droplets the more reactive monomer (DVB) tends to polymerize first than the less reactive (S). This causes a not uniform structure in the polymer particles between internal and external layers. The Patent proposes a semi-batch process where the ratio of DVB/S in the feed during polymerization is lower than the ratio used in the initial load. The change of the composition counter reacts the difference of reactivity and the whole copolymer composition results more uniform. Patent claims a saving of 12% of DVB per equal MHC.

## **Dispersion aids in suspension polymerization**
The suspension polymerization of PVC requires two kind of suspension aids: 
1. Primary dispersants added to stabilize the vinyl chloride monomer droplets and control their size. They are mainly poly vinyl alcohols (PVAs) with high solubility and supplied in water solution
2. Secondary dispersants needed to increase the porosity of the polymer particles after reaction and avoid their adhesion to the reactor wall. They are PVAs with a low saponification degree (70 % or less) water insoluble and supplied in alcohol solution.
PVAs are industrially produced by polymerizing a vinyl ester monomer in an alcohol solution at atmospheric pressure and saponifying the resultant vinyl ester polymer. More hydroxyl groups are generated when saponification is high and the polymer becomes more water soluble.
[7] focalizes on the production of primary PVA dispersants with low molecular weight discovering three new kinds of water-soluble molecular weight regulators. It discovers the transferring agent effect of alcohols, aldehyde or thiols having an aliphatic hydrocarbon group with 6-12 carbon atoms.
[8] found a secondary PVA dispersant efficient in its role and stable in water solution. The hydrophobic tails in the PVA are reduced combining adjacent tails in the structure: -C1CC(R)OC(-)O1 where R is an alkyl group. The new PVA is made by a sequence of 6 atoms rings with two Oxygens and a short alkyl branch. The method of obtaining the constituent unit is not limited and the preferred is by acetalization of PVA (partially saponified) with aliphatic aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde). By acetalization the hydrophobicity of the dispersant can be modulated to optimize the solubility and the surface activity. The residual alcohols of acetalization are left in the dispersion as useful stabilizers.
