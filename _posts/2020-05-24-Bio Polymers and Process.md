## **Biobased polyesters**
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most common thermoplastic polyester used for its excellent combination of clarity, mechanical and gas barrier properties. Depending of its processing and thermal history, PET may exist both as amorphous (high transparency) and as a semi crystalline (low gas permeation) polymer. The polymer is synthetized by terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol or by transesterification between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate. To modulate transparency and workability some further ingredients (such as cyclo hexanedimethanol or isophthalic acid) can partially replace the main ingredients. This interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer melting temperature and these comonomers are usually named “crystallization retarders”. As a result, a comfortable blow molding provides articles clear and crystalline enough to be adequate barriers to gas as carbon dioxide. Due to the general trend of replacing petrochemically-derived raw materials by raw material coming from biologically based materials (or biomaterials) and thanks to the huge PET market, a vast research is running [1]. [2] grants the rights to cover many of these results. It relates to a process for producing PET from at least one ingredient (among terephthalate compounds or glycols) obtained from a bio-based material including compositions with the most common crystallization retarders. According to the invention, the process is carried out in industrial facilities already used for processing PET from fossil origin. The only difference is that all the starting materials are bio-based compounds, i.e. obtained from vegetal source. To make the definition clear, the patent specifies several path-ways already know in literature to obtain terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol by natural source. [3] limits the origin of PET to the polymer chains having terephthalate containing carbons sourced from bio-based ethanol. He specifies how to detect the origin of the carbon used in the polymer by the method ASTM D6866. Isotope 14C, oxidized into carbon dioxide, represents a small but measurable fraction of atmospheric carbon. Atmospheric carbon is cycled by green plants to make organic molecules during photosynthesis. Therefore, the 14C that exists in the atmosphere becomes part of all life forms and their biological products, such as renewable based organic molecules. Petroleum-based carbon does not have the signature radiocarbon ratio of atmospheric carbon dioxide (or less than 0.1 % of atmospheric amount) since the isotope already decomposed.
The only alternative left for the PET replacement is to find a polyester with different chemical composition. As PET alternatives, polyesters made by furanic monomers are highly considered [4]. They arise from acid -catalyzed thermal dehydration of sugars. Also, the standard production of polyesters from furan dicarboxylic acids and diols by polycondensation reaction is revised. [5] disclosed the possibility of making furanic polyester oligomers in a ring closing oligomerization step. [6] discloses the process of making a polyester by using the previous polyester oligomers having furanic units together with a plasticizer. By this route, the process does not produce large quantities of water or alcoholic side products nor it requires high capacity devolatilization units. The plasticizer plays a key role not only reducing the viscosity and the melting point of the reactants, but improving the intimate contact with the catalysts. Plasticizers are optionally -substituted phenyl ether or xylene, a polyether (e.g. tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) and mixtures. In some cases, the plasticizer could be a low molecular fraction (< 1500 g/mol) of the resulting polyester itself. Finally, [7] and [8] observe that semi-crystalline furanic polyesters undergo to solid state polymerization. Gradually increasing the temperature of polymer pellets from 90 to 200 C (1-8 C /hour), the molecular weight of the polymer proportionally increases. Useful observation especially in polyester reprocessing.

## **Physically cross-linked lactide polymers**
Lactide polymers are interesting since they are biodegradable and biocompatible. However, [9] found another peculiar property i.e. the physical cross-linking in semi crystalline form. Polymer networks are made by covalent net points such as in rubber or carbomer, but non-covalent net points are possible. In semi-crystalline polymers for instance, crystallites may serve as temporary net points. Networks provide an elastic behavior useful in application even after molding (extrusion or 3D printing). The patent proposes a blend of two stereo complexes: poly-D-lactide (PDLA) and poly-L-lactide (PLLA) with a melting point crystallinity in the range of 200-230 C. Both polymers are prepared by a solvent-based process. After the preparation of the blends a thermal post processing treatment is required (tempering) in order to obtain crystallites in sufficient number. Typically, the tempering is performed in a temperature range of 60 to 120 c and required a long time.

## **Cellulosic fibers via ionic liquid solutions**
Fibers made from renewable resources such as cellulosic fibers are very well know but their market will certainly improve in the future. [10] focalizes on a new dry-wet process that allow s a wide performance property optimization (high strength and good elasticity). In a dry-wet spinning process, the fibers (obtained by the kraft process from wood) are made by extrusion, they pass through an air gap for partial hardening and finally they run into a coagulation bath which contains a precipitant for the polymer. The novelty of the process is mainly in the use of ionic liquid salt which has a melting point of less than 100 C (e.g. ENIM: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium octanoate) to dissolve the cellulose (degree of polymerization 400-800) prior the extrusion. The spinning solution can be produced by conventional processes, e.g. cellulose may be mixed with ionic liquid and dissolved at elevated temperature (110 C). Cellulose is 10 to 14 parts by weight per 100 parts of ionic liquid. A single core-progressive screw extruder makes the fibers from the solution. The pressure reaches 200 bars at the die having a hole diameter of 60-90 microns. Two rotating rollers, which are arranged one above the other (godet duo) drive the fiber to the air trap and later to the coagulation batch. When immersing in the batch with a non-solvent (typically water), the fiber still contains ionic liquid and release it there. In this way ionic liquid accumulates over time in the coagulation batch and when it reaches the 30 wt % is recovered by distillation.

## **Ionic polymers for biomass degradation**
Ionic liquids (IL) used to dissolve cellulose must be separated from the products after decomposition. Due to their toxicity the separation could be costly if food grade and human consumption sugars are expected. In order to facilitate the recovery of ILs, polymer of the component ILs have been proposed under the name of Ionic Polymers (IP). [11] shows a series of IPs functionalized with sulfonic acid (-SO3H), that are very efficient catalysts in acidic cellulose hydrolysis. The polymers are made by radical solution polymerization on modified IL salts; a further polymerization with acrylic acid can bring to a film forming material and finally to a membrane. The biomass made by cellulosic residuals is heated in the presence of the IP in a water solution of a mineral acid. The decomposition brings lipids, sugars or furanic compounds depending of the initial vegetal source. The preferred application drives to sweetening or flavoring agent, bulking agents or substrates for fermentation process.
[12] moves in the same area but avoids any separation because it incorporates IPs in membranes for the biomass process. Several IP structures are modified in order to add some allyl or vinyl groups (e.g. acrylic acid) together with the sulfonic groups. Then, either the IP itself may form a membrane or IP may be incorporated in a preformed membrane. In some cases, IPs are adsorbed on a solid support that is used a inorganic filler.

## **New Melanin compound**
[13] shows how to provide a process for preparing a homogeneous compound of a synthetic polymer and melanins. In recent years, there has been interest in extracting, using and compounding biopolymers: melanin, cellulose, chitin and collagen. Melanins constitute a fascinating class of biopolymers that is found in most organisms including plants, fungi, animals and even bacteria. They have been attributed to several different functions that include adsorption of ultraviolet radiation and dissipation into harmless heat, metal ion chelation, thermoregulation, antibiotic activity and free-radical quenching. Natural melanins are amorphous pigments that are insoluble in almost all organic solvents and this has caused few attempts to create functional polymeric materials and composites which incorporate this biopolymer. The patent suggests the dissolution of polymer and melamine in tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution under continuous stirring followed by incorporation in film, fibers, coating and shaped forms. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) is a common strong bases used in water and alcohol solution in organic synthesis. The polymer is cellulose, silk, natural polysaccharides and proteins but [14] extend to the synthetic class. Both natural melanin (from Sepia Officinalis) and synthetic melanin derived by auto-oxidation of 3,4 -dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA melanin) are used.

## **Polymerization of β-butyrolactone**
Poly 3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biopolymer produced by microorganisms as a strictly isotactic polyester of the monomer 3-(R)-hydroxybutyric acid. Interest comes as biodegradable and renewable source with thermoplastic properties similar to polypropylene. Up to now the fermentation of glucose is the main production way to produce PHB but [15] proposes a synthetic route. β-butyrolactone is a monomer obtainable by addition of CO on propylene oxide, i.e. largely available species. He found a catalyst/initiator system comprising a rare earth metal, a chiral ligand and optionally an alkali-based co-catalyst that allows to polymerize β-butyrolactone to obtain isotactic PHB with a value grade of crystallinity (above 60% ca). The catalyst/initiator system can be prepared in situ, i.e. the components of the system can be added to the monomer composition and the system provides the catalytic activity directly.

## **Catalyst in biobased polycarbonates production**
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a highly attractive feedstock when copolymerized with epoxides to yield aliphatic polycarbonates [16].The synthesis requires a metal complex catalyst and the process result in a crude product containing the catalyst, which can degrade and discolor the polymer over time. [17] proposes a new bimetallic catalyst and [18] found a method to deactivate and remove the same catalyst. The catalyst can be quenched with an acid containing an anion that is effective to act as an initiator for the polymerization but is also effective to deactivate the catalyst. The molar ratio between the acid and the catalyst must be less or equal than 20:1. It is thought that a complex is formed between the catalyst and the anion of the acid (for example acetate, if acetic acid is used as the acid). Once, CO2 is removed from the reaction, the presence of the catalyst polymer complex can lead to degradation of the polymer chain. Instead, the formation of the complex between the catalyst and the anion of the acid does not affect the polymer degradation. Most preferably, the acid may be a multifunctional carboxylic acid, such as dicarboxylic, tricarboxylic and salicylic acids.

## **New super adsorbent polymers**
Being products, which adsorb aqueous solutions, super-adsorbent polymers (SAP) are used to produce diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins and other hygiene articles, but also as water retaining agents in market gardening. SAP can adsorb and retain (becoming hydrogel) extremely large amounts of a liquid relative to their own mass measured in term of g of water / g of polymer. Synthetic super-adsorbents are based mainly on the bulk polymerization of melted maleic anhydride with comonomers like: methacrylic acid and styrene together with monomeric or polymeric cross-linkers. Suitable reactors are kneading reactors with contra-rotatory stirrer shafts or belt reactors.
The degree of crosslinking affects the adsorbent capacity and gel strength of SAP material. Polymers exhibiting inadequate gel strength will form a hydrogel that deforms inhibiting the fluid distribution throughout the article. Polymers having a low adsorbent capacity are incapable of adsorbing a sufficient amount of fluid especially in thin articles. Moreover, a high amount of low molecular weight polymers can leach out from the gel resulting in lower quality. The Absorbency Under Load (AUL) is the typical physical parameter that characterize the quality of SAP together with the centrifuge retention capacity (CRC) 
[19] releases a new process to achieve materials with superior properties: CRC from 35 to 75 g/g and AUL from 20 to 50 g/g difficult to obtain in combination. The process requires a thermal post-crosslinking treatment on spherical polymer particles. Although the surface crosslinking is efficient since it is made at low temperatures (100-180 C), the requirement of spherical particles makes the polymerization more difficult. Spherical particles are produced by polymerizing droplets of the monomer solution in a surrounding heated gas phase. Droplets are generated by an oscillating plate with a multitude of bores. A hot gas flows cocurrent to the free-following droplets from the top downward. This leaves a 15% unreacted monomer that need to be converted in a following fluidized bed. As a particular advantage of the round shape particles is the lack of edges that can be easily be broken by processing stress in diapers production and during swelling. There are no breakpoints on the surface that could lead to loss of mechanical strength.
The environmental impact of baby diapers is becoming an impressive problem due to rapid growth. So, [20] proposes a new biodegradable super-adsorbent compound. It adsorbs aqueous solution through hydrogen bonding up to 100 g/g. The water-soluble composite is made by:
- A standard linear poly (styrene-maleic acid) copolymer (SMAC)
- A natural biopolymer such as gelatin (10-15 wt %)
- Repeated thermal cross-linking operations after coating with PEG-200 or other hydroxyl based biodegradable compounds.
The process uses the standard reactors and does not requires plant upgrades. The material respects the standard technological requirements, i.e.:
- Absorbency Under Load (AUL) > 20 g/g
- Granulometry > 100 micron
 and add a correspondent biodegradation property up to the 20-22 %.

Hygiene articles such as diapers and incontinent pads are designed to adsorb bodily fluids such as urine and consequently malodor is a common issue. Numerous attempts have been made through appropriate additions of additives for odor-inhibition or odor-reduction. The use of lower pH additives, enzyme inhibitors and chelants are only effective in delaying the formation of ammonia from urine and have little effect on organic molecule odor. Malodor is caused by large variety of chemicals including ketones, aldehydes, amines and mercaptans. One way could be a radical oxidation of the whole species. [21] releases a post treatment of the super-adsorbent polymers by the addition (up to 1.7%) of a peroxo compound. Both inorganic (e.g. peroxo mono sulphate triple salt) and organic (e.g. peroxo carboxylic acids) substances are considered. The additive may be added at the end of production process or just before the drying step.
