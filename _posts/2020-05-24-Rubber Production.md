## **Functionalized polymers for tire production**
The increasing cost of solvent recovery pushes to reconsider the whole polymerization process. Polydienes may also be produced by bulk (or mass) polymerization, wherein conjugated diene monomer is polymerized in the absence of any solvent, and, in effect, the monomer itself acts as a diluent. This offers a number of economic advantages including lower capital cost for new plant capacity, lower energy cost and few people to operate. The solvent-less feature also provides environmental advantages with emissions and waste water pollution being reduced. Bulk polymerization requires very careful temperature control, and there is also the need for strong and elaborate stirring equipment since the viscosity of the polymerization mixture can become very high. [1] proposes a solution to these problems by a three-step continuous process. In first step diene monomers are polymerized by a lanthanide-based catalyst with low activity. The moderate reaction kinetic rate allows an efficient heat removal in the temperature range (20-100 C) and a good control of the conversion up to 20%. Due to the lower amount of polymer the stream has a moderate viscosity and is easily moved to a second vessel. Here, a heterocyclic nitrile compound is added and acts as a radical terminator in mild condition (20-30 C for 10-60 minutes). After a quenching with alcohols or water, the stream is sent to a devolatilization unit. A screw or paddle apparatus allows the complete residual monomer removal and the final processing of the polymer with a twin-screw extruder. The functionalized poly-dienes are employed in the manufacture of tires by standard rubber shaping, molding and curing techniques. They are employed to reduced hysteresis, i.e. the loss of mechanical energy to heat, and provide a low rolling resistance.
[2] proposes an intermediate solution. The polymerization starts as a bulk polymerization till the conversion reaches 30% ca. Then the reacting mixture including a polydiene and unreacted monomer is diluted in an organic solvent (e.g. aliphatic hydrocarbon). The polymerization is now a solution polymerization and advantageously provides effective temperature control, reduces the viscosity and increases the monomer conversion. This second part of the process can be carried out in a transfer pipe, in a dynamic or static mixer. Preferred set up of this process are: horizontal reactors are suitable for the bulk polymerization and a heated screw apparatus, such as a desolventizing extruder, for evaporating the solvent under atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressure. 
[3] further refines the process focalizing on the quenching agent used to terminate the polymerization prior a significant monomer conversion. The ratio of water in the quenching agent to the lanthanide atoms in the catalyst must be less than 1500 to 1. A limited amount of water as quenching agent exhibits advantageous cold flow resistance. An excessive amount, as commonly employed, leads to decoupling of polymers that are believed to be coupled by the heterocyclic nitrile functionality. This results in a decrease of cold flow resistance which is problematic during tire storage.

## **Process improvements for rubber production**
Rubbers are produced from multi-olefins and iso-olefins by carbo cationic polymerization. The chemical mechanism is complex and involve an initiator and a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride. The type of monomers, the solvent and its polarity, the polymerization temperature and the specific combination of initiator and Lewis acid affect the propagation step. Industry has generally accepted a slurry polymerization in methyl chloride as a solvent, and the reaction is carried out at low temperature, generally lower than -90 C. An acceptable low viscosity of the solution (40 % polymer) has to be maintained enabling the heat of polymerization to be removed via heat exchange across the surface of the reactor. Several patents propose the use of condensed volatile solvent to improve temperature control. The evaporation requires a defined enthalpy and thus auto-control the temperature above the boiling point of the solvent. The evaporated refrigerant is typically recycled and used again. [4] proposes a process in ethane or carbon dioxide and gives all the details of the whole production in batch or continuous layout. [5] defines optimal catalysts and process conditions.
When natural rubber is epoxidized under carefully controlled conditions, it can be converted to a totally new polymer with some properties more akin to specialty rubbers and some properties that appear advantageous for tire tread such as lower rolling resistance and better wet traction, even in combination. Maybe this is the undefined goal of [6] focused on a process for producing epoxidized polymers. The process involves dissolving a rubber in a solvent and epoxidizing the rubber in the presence of an epoxidation reagent having an aqueous phase pH in the range of 1.5 to 7.0. The solvent and the reaction conditions are selected such that the rubber is soluble therein and the epoxidized rubber self-precipitates. Solvents are liquid alkanes, e.g. n-pentane, the temperature is about -20 to 35 C, the peracid is peracetic acid mainly. Several kinds of natural rubbers precipitate in 2.5 hour after epoxidation and the material is achieved after steam stripping and drying. 
A simple process for rubber epoxidation without the use of solvent or catalyst is presented by [7] . He found that if a unsatured polymer and a peroxo acid are dry mixed in a mill or extruder or blade mixer the epoxidation may run up to 100 % of substitution. The rubber could be any rubber with preference to halogenate polymer, the peracid could be peracetic acid (solid or in solution), the mixing temperature is self-maintained around 50 C and the residence time 0.5 hour approximately. In spite of the simplicity of the manufacturing process the epoxidized polymer may be further cures by any suitable method (e.g. sulfur-base cure) as the competitor materials.
Brominated isobutylene rubber (BIIR) is an elastomeric isobutylene-isoprene copolymer containing reactive bromine [8] .It displays better co-vulcanization properties with unsatured general purpose elastomers while maintain the physical strength and resistance of polyolefins. Bromo butyl compounds combine low permeability to the passage of air and moisture with high level of co-curing compatibility to elastomers. Now, BIIRs are very important ingredients in tire formulations and the interest is still growing. [9] releases an interesting solvent free process to increase the impact resistance and thermostability of BIIRs. It functionalizes the rubber backbone by grafting pendant groups via an atom transfer radical polymerization reaction. In a 6-blade solid mixer (Brabender), the rubber is functionalized by a nucleophile such as thioacetate (e.g. potassium tio acetate) in presence of a catalyst (e.g. TBAB teratbutyl ammonium bromide). The temperature is limited (up to 150 max and reaction time ae quite limited (20 min).
