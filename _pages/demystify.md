Now, patents are written by professionals and are the results of a team work. Everybody working in a structured company knows that authors provide only a limited amount of technical information. Two, three pages only. By the work of layers, mandataries, marketing and strategist experts, patents become tens or even hundred pages long. Several reasons explain the effect:

- providing a general patent coverage of the matter
- including the subject in a broader company strategy
- including potential future development
- masking the commercial interest of the company
- providing a defense of competitor actions

just to mention some possibilities. The practical effect that people (chemists, engineers or researchers) interested in technical aspects only found information diluted in a large amount of useless information.

A procedure to recover the original idea that inspired the patent becomes fundament for its deep comprehension.

The process is in some way similar to the reverse engineering of compiled code that explains the real nature of an algorithm. However, as in informatic, the reverse procedure is not unique. Although possible, nobody, except authors, can know which is the basic idea of patent. A common reader can only guess what is the deep purpose, the real innovation and the original tests and experiences that originate the patent. The reverse procedure is based on the experience in patent reading, subject knowledge and practical experience on the matter.

Although patent literature contains a lot of information their assessment become long and tedious. The possibility to reduce this effort seems quite convenient and this is the real purpose of this blog.

Since, for professional and personal interest I have to read several patents in the area where I am more experience, I decided to share what I am constantly doing.

The blog contains my personal reverse procedure to recover the technical information inside the patent literature in polymer science.

The following items detail the main limitation of this apparently massive work:

> General topics: process, plant, control of polymer science and engineering
> Time: patent disclosed from January 2019
> Area: America (US), European (EP) and Worldwide (WO)
> Language: English
